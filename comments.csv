0,merc1,March 2002,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.  That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.  The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.  The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.  Lexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.  The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.  The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.  Don't really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.  The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.  M"
1,fredvh,March 2002,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.
2,blueguydotcom,March 2002,"Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around. Easy winner."
3,hungrywhale,March 2002,"And no manual tranny. That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.  So IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
4,riez,March 2002,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from. Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan. Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!  hungrywhale... I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
5,blueguydotcom,March 2002,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
6,hungrywhale,March 2002,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. I don't care how fast it is. It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
7,blueguydotcom,March 2002,"I understand it's not about the speed. I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark. What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it. Will I buy an auto-equipped G? In all likelihood, no. I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
8,hungrywhale,March 2002,It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
9,riez,March 2002,"Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan? Not in my book. Certainly not in Europe or Asia. Only in America is such an oxymoron possible. Sad.  If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
10,wishnhigh1,March 2002,"If I had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what I would choose:  Audi A4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)  Cadillac CTS( Decent BTFB, good handling, non-lemming style)  Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)  BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)  SAAB Viggen(almost zero BFTB, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world).  Everything else is not worth my time"
11,shipo,March 2002,"Hey my friend, dig this, in Australia, the ONLY 5-Series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the M5! Yeah, right, not the 525i, 530i, 535i or the 540i, they are all automatic only. :-(  Best Regards, Shipo"

If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment.""  Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics.  When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.  I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.  I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.  Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.  Cheers!"
13,hungrywhale,March 2002,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them  But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny. Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.  There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."
14,blueguydotcom,March 2002,amen
15,dave330i,March 2002,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling.  I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
16,blueguydotcom,March 2002,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it. Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one. They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
17,wishnhigh1,March 2002,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though.  Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
18,dave330i,March 2002,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""  How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?  Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
19,riez,March 2002,"I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll let you lead services!  mbarto... I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out. I promise!!! Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans. But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans. (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic. If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
20,wishnhigh1,April 2002,"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.  And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?  So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
21,kd6aw1,April 2002,"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time. I have an automatic G35 and love it. Being that it is an automatic I can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic. If I feel the urge which I don't very often I can shift the manumatic and pretend it is a stick. When I get my Ferrari it will have the paddle shifting because I don't ever want another clutch! Just my opinion!  Paul  El Cajon, California"
22,fwatson,April 2002,"How does your theory explain English cars? A country steeped in tradition producing poor quality cars with little inovation? Look what a traditionalist country managed to do to the Acura Legend when they produced it as a Stirling. LOL  ====================================  Quote wishnhigh1: ""What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.""  ====================================  Those cars in general reflect the perfectionist attitude of 1pierce's post. With virtually no exception, the overall quality of Japanese brand cars, especially fit and finish, considerably excels the American brands. From what I have read, this is due to the attitude of Japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship. Not the abilities of the assembly line workers. You may have a point though, that some of the Japanese brands show as high a level of innovation as the American and German brands. After all, which country has used the Wankle rotary, and Miller cycle engines? And who introduced us to the VTEC engines etc?  American management leans strongly to the bottom line and CEO bonuses, with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style."
23,dave330i,April 2002,"""Being that it is an automatic I can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic.""  Truly critical things to do while one's driving."
24,blueguydotcom,April 2002,"He did mention ""in rush hour traffic."" Like there's anything else to do in bumper-to-bumper. Not like rush hour demands anything of the driver. I've read books while in traffic. Let out clutch, apply gas, push in clutch, glide, repeat. Snooze."
25,fredvh,May 2002,"Edmunds has a new feature called ""True Cost To Own"". It is listed when one researches out the various vehicles on the new car heading. It is one of the 13 subjects when you click on a particular vehicle. It is very useful when comparing one vehicle to another. ""True Cost To Own"" takes the purchase price and adds things like depreciation, insurance, license fees, etc. and gives you a figure for 5-yr ownership. They even tailor it to your particular zip code. I tried it on a few vehicles and it is very useful."
26,cybersol,May 2002,"I have not had a chance to look at it in person, but does the 38K Passat W8 fit into the entry -level performance luxury sedan category? Any other upcoming (next year or so) vehicles fit into this category?"
27,blueguydotcom,May 2002,But it's not really a performance sedan. Drive one and then take on a Bimmer or G35. Night and day. VWs are nice inside and good for cruising but their handling's akin to riding a pig in a hurry.
28,rayainsw,May 2002,"I beg to differ.  While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.  I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice. I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways. For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.  (Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)  Take straight line acceleration, for instance. VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec. To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan. My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims. And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. I base this on a number of things. For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic. The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258. And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. We&#146;ll see. . . (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. This was my previous car. So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)  Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package. Almost certainly no. But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.  Just my opinions.  Cheers, - Ray Off shortly to put on a few more &#145;break-in&#146; miles at lunch . . ."
29,cmnott,June 2002,"I recently went through the list of entry level cars...I was in test drive heaven!  325i - very nice car, best shifter/clutch of all, but not enough power for me. Great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. With leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don't.  330i - same as above but better power, although I find the power to be linear. You can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. I like that sunroof and leather are std. Better value overall than 325i plus std. 17"" wheels (although with all-seasons). Pricy.  IS300- Nice manual tranny and smooth motor. That's about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy.  X-Type - I liked the 3.0L Sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. Didn't look like a jag. Very nearly purchased a 3.0L British Racing Green with Ivory Leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the BMW look like a bargain hunter. Too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. Brakes were strong. One thing about the motor was it just didn't feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised. Nicest interior overall.  A4 3.0 - Porky, ponderous even with sport package. Did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. Nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. By the way, the leather in the BMW was much better.  S4 (2001)- Nice but not as fast as I thought it would be (I did drive a 99 Mustang GT). It rockets off the line but it isn't that impressive afterwards. Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4. I think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note. An exhaust would be perfect here. They were giving them away (9000$ off MSRP - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.  G35 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, I wasn't interested one bit. I still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the S4). Nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers. I really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. The fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the A4 3.0 and BMW 330i was close.  Lincoln LS V6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. Engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move. Torque is lacking here. But I liked the car overall, especially with the Sport susp.  Acura TL-S, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite V6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. Interior average and handling so-so. Excellent price.  Volvo S60 T5 - I chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the S4 is quite close to the S4, and it is lighter) FWD torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no question about it. Best seats, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the Jaguar and BMW. Brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to. Amazing power and style. Seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest. Price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than BMW, Audi, Jaguar.  Didn't drive the CTS but I am sure it is excellent.  In conclusion these are all excellent cars and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them, I would be fine with any of them in my driveway. Honestly."
30,blueguydotcom,June 2002,"I had the grave misfortune to drive a CTS, and it's not in the same league as the Bimmer, Audi, Infiniti or even the lesser Acura/Lexus/Jag.  The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!). The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad. The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials. The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal. The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing. The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own. Handling? Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making. It was a slow reacting boat...turn the wheels, feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions. Not impressive in the least. In fact when the salesguy asked me what I thought after the drive I told him the CTS wasn't even a real competitor to the germans or japanese. He snorted and reminded me, ""This is a caddy, not a sports car."" Yeah, well that Caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have."
31,jagboyxkr,June 2002,"Congradulations on your new S60 T5! It is a great looking car, and I hope you are very happy with it. I saw a really nice one in front of me this morning. Have fun with it!"
32,cmnott,June 2002,"Hey blueguy, what wrond with the Mustang tranny! I know it is not a FWD type gearbox but when you have 300 lb.ft. of torque twisting that car, you need a strong tranny. In all honesty, the clutch, while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay, but with a purpose. never missed a gear either, which can't be said about the A4 6-speed...  jagboyxkr, I know you have an X-Type and I was right in there to the end with this car. Bottom line was 10000CDN difference. The way they package the options is ridiculous. i needed the split fold seats, but they were bundled in a $2000 package. Xenons? Twice asmuch as any other car, $1600.00. Sunroof? another 1600.00. It was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low (1.9%) which helped make up the difference.  I don't care what anybody says about the X-Type, because most have never driven them, it is IMO, a better overall car than the Audi. In Canada, AWD is recommended...this car gets slaughtered because of its high price. This car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class, but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market.  The T5 is broken in nicely, I have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything I expected. What i didn't expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100km'h. I think it would beat my Mustang at that speed in a rolling start, no question. i would even say an S4..."
33,blueguydotcom,June 2002,"Hey, I've never driven an 18 wheeler, so maybe the Mustang's tranny isn't like one, but that's how I imagine a big rig's tranny to feel."

I loved those bimmers and audi was a great car but the bottom line sticker is what made me go with the Acura. with the steptronic this car is an absolute joy, I went from a 1993dodge P.O.S.

39,eaweg,June 2002,"So that stones aren't casted at one another, I would like to remind everyone that this is my opinion which is why we have these forums.  Cmnott, I respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 3.0...although I strongly disagree. I guess as a 3.0 owner I would. I personally found the jag x-type to be the worst car I have ever test driven. First, it was $3000 more than the Audi. Second, well it is a ford and felt like a ford. The handling in no way compared to the 3.0. The interior might ""look"" a little better but certainly did not ""feel"" any better. AS for performance, I am a little dissapointed with th 3.0 and I think they could have used a 250-260 hp engine to solve the problems. However, it is still a fun engine...especially at highway speeds. I honetsly felt that the Mondeo (excuse me, x-type) was going to fall apart on my test drive.  Now I know Audi has had its problems but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the x-type!  Oh well...to each their own! Enjoy your T5!!!"
40,atluskane,September 2002,Does anyone find that the TL has extrememly boring styling. I've only seen white TL's and they don't look exciting but I haven't seen a darker colored TL. Do the darker colored TL's look better? Also anyone who owns a TL type S how fast does it go from 0-60? I'm curious because I'm crosshopping with the G35. If the Tl Type S can at least compete with G35's performance that I would be happy
41,techhawk,September 2002,"The TL-S does have boring styling and white is its worst color. It fairs better in darker colors. The overall performance is similar to the G35, though it gets edged out in most categories. The biggest difference is FWD vs. RWD. I spent quite a bit of time in a TL-S when shopping recently. I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable.  For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T. Good luck with your shopping."

If you read their auto issue they give the TL their highest rating for reliability including the transmission. Is their something wrong here?
46,kdshapiro,September 2002,"I read Consumers as well. My theory is that the percentage is higher than zero, which took Honda by surprise. Isolated incidents over tens and thousands of vehicles sold, make it a small statistical probability. This doesn't mean there isn't a design flaw somewhere. For every mass produced car has some flaw, no matter how inexpensive or expensive. However at this point there is a lot of hubris over it. Should I be purchasing an Acura, this would not be a factor."
47,riez,September 2002,"Check out their November 2002 issue. Page 82. Their long-term testing. As they put it, it is ""good"" but not ""great"" and not worth the price. And it ""does have its good points, but, unfortunately, it doesn't have enough of them."" Or, it ""doesn't live up to its nameplate or its pricetag.""  They pan the engine (noise & power), weight, stereo sound, lack of in-dash CD player, clutch, handling, etc.  This article follows an earlier one (09/02 issue) in which they pointed out the X-type's many flaws and few virtues."
48,riez,September 2002,"jagboyxtype... If you want most other marque's models, you have to order vanilla. Maybe a chocolate or strawberry. Your X-type offers choice of automatic or manual and 2.5L or 3.0L engines. IS300 offers SportCross. But only the 3 Series offers so much more. Sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, and ultra-high performance models. AWD and RWD. Automatic and manual. Choice of engines. Is it BMW's fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many variants and give buyers so many choices? I say you could also add Z3 sales to the mix, too!"
49,jagboyxtype,September 2002,"Oh, that's too bad. It's also too bad that they failed to notice that:  -The X-TYPE does have an indash CD-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.  -Out of the group of European sport sedans (e.g. BMW 3, Mercedes-Benz C, Audi A4) the Jaguar X has the most powerful engines.  -The Jaguar Alpine sound system is rated very highly. The auto's section of my newspaper rated the Jaguar Alpine system the top system out of premium European cars in a big comparison test of car stereos. Lexus won the Japanese premium car sound system category with its ML system.  -The car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the C-320 Sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-Series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - Car&Driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - Road&Track). With its AWD, it can corner like no other car.  -Braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the Porsche 911 GT2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. Thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller BMW M-Roadster (118 ft.). Brakes are from the larger S-TYPE.  -Connoly leather and wood are all standard in the Jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.  -It has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.  -Synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for Audi's A6 and new A8, which are ""industry leading"" according to many.  -The X-TYPE does weigh a little more than a RWD car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its AWD, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance. It actually helps it in many ways. Also, for instance, it weighs less than an Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, and Lincoln LS.  -There is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes. There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.  -Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.  -Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.  About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats. Beyond those, it's one hellofa car. I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car. ______________________________________  On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article. Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem. Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."
50,riez,September 2002,jagboyxtype... Have you been reading what European Car has been writing? I'd encourage you to read their articles. They have a web site. I didn't write them. Please don't shoot me. I just passed along what an interesting source said. I happen to agree with many of their comments. Not all. And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
51,jagboyxtype,September 2002,"""Please don't shoot me.""  I wasn't trying to shoot you. You are just being paranoid. I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along. I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant. I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own. Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars. As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.  BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE. Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one. However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:  ""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!  I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""
52,affy,September 2002,"Why isn't Audi considering shipping the A3, S3 here, i belive there's a lot of market potential here in our shore. It make perfect sense to have a A3 to battle against the Benz C-230 coupe and the BMW 320i. I saw picture of the A3 and it look ok, right now i'm considering to purchase an A4 3.0, i want to comapre the A4 3.0 and the S3. Audi should ship the lux-golf here!"
53,riez,September 2002,"jagboyxtype... Ya gotta stay calm. Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""  Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written? The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America. Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test. See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison. Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.  Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?  And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc. To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
54,riez,September 2002,"jagboyxtype... Do you read MT or R&T?  Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend. MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison. In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling. Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. Track results mediocre. Fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. Worst braking result. They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.  Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track. R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison. X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. They tested a loaded $46,510 one.  Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT? Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? And test driving the X-type against its competitors?"
55,merc1,September 2002,"Isn't that comparo a little bit much? I mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat raming"" or ""pummelling"" ? I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto. I have nothing against the X-Type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.  One other thing: Who says the X-Type has the most rigid structure in this class? I've read that the C320 Sport, 330i and especially the A4 all have very stout structures. This has also been my experience in driving all three of them.  M"
56,riez,September 2002,"jagboyxtype... Check out the February 2002 issue of Car and Driver. 7 car comparison. X-type 3.0 MANUAL came in 5th place. Woes included lack of overall performance, poor ride quality, poor brakes, and poor skidpad. X-type was tied for 2nd slowest 0-60 mph time (7.2 seconds), longest braking distance, 2nd worst skidpad result, but did have the 2nd best emergency-lane-change maneuver mph. C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.  Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.  Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me. The X-type 2.5 is more the entry-level Jaguar."
57,dpvwia2,September 2002,How about the fact that it look like a Ford Contour? Yikes...
58,jagboyxtype,September 2002,"Merc1-  The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series. You may check out AutoWeek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their ""Autocar Book"" all about the X-TYPE. I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.  Also, as riez would say, ""I did not write the article"". The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. Take braking (""top drawer"" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven. ____________________________________  Riez-  I pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. Listen to what you've been sayin: ""Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this"". Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.  ""Do you read MT or R&T?"" you ask me. Sometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes. Why? Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. And I am not the only one who feels that way. ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend's opinions of the car as an example:  ""For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its '10 Best Cars of the Year.' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)"" http://www.abcnews.com  Hmmm. Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend. Well, they can have it, and I'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.  ABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"". MotorTrend's own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.  The warning at the end of the article reads: ""So far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""  It can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.  ""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?"" you also ask me. Yes, I have. European Car's own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. Road&Track's review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary. Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car. MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""This new X is one shaggy Jaggy"" and ""I'm anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan"". AutoWeek liked the car and decided that ""X"" was definitely an addition to the ""A"", ""C"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation. Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE. And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""Most Important Jaguar Ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".  You mention ""American"" tests in your posts. I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?  On the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say: ""So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test? That's easy: Price."" Notice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was. The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment. The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did. A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly. Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped. La"
59,jagboyxtype,September 2002,"<continued>Later in that same R&T issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those cars, a long-term X-TYPE.  Also, on price, let's not complain about the X-TYPE when Road&Track's $39,804 (and I count that as near $40,000, wouldn't you?) BMW 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo (page 74 of their ""Road Test Annual 2002"").   So what else did R&T say about the X-TYPE in that 11 car test? How about ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves.' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either...our test car's optional 3.0-litre 4-cam V-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...Overall, the X-TYPE is a comfortable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...It's a good all-rounder with, probably just as much British charm as most modern drivers really want. Independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings."" As a side note, they also say, ""The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivered surprisingly good handling"". http://www.roadandtrack.com   And most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, comfortable interior. Yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt't get ""panned"" as you have continually been repeating.   Let's also not overlook the TOP GEAR 2002 Motoring Survey, in which ""over 37,000 motorists"" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. The rankings for the entry-level cars were:  1.) Lexus IS 200  2.) Jaguar X-TYPE  3.) BMW 3-Series  4.) Mercedes-Benz C-Class  5.) Audi A4 and A4 Avant (wagon)  6.) Saab 9-3  7.) Volvo S40 and V40 (wagon)  8.) Alfa Romeo 156   They had little quotes by some of the cars. The X-TYPE's read: ""Just past its first anniversary and the X-Type enters the survey three places ahead of the BMW 3-Series [out of the total 120 cars]. Great dealer service, few problems and good dynamics see to that.""   Let's not argue here though riez. We both have opinions, and I simply don't agree with yours. Hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)  __________________________________   dpvwia2-   The whole Jaguar/Ford thing died a long time ago. X-TYPE shares 6 points on its platform with the Mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. Anyone could just as easily say that your A4 is just a Jetta with four rings on its grille.  _________________________________   Pat-   Sorry, I thought that you had already deleted the post as it had not appeared on my page until I clicked on ""scroll up"". I had just assumed that you had taken care of it when I didn't see it load on the page I was at."
60,jagboyxtype,October 2002,"Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. Most all cars do. In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.  The warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here. Notice that the C-Class had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars. I'm not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.   You are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. Most modern cars do this. X-TYPE's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.   You really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:   http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002   It specifically states that the car is: ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD. Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration. The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.   Mercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here). The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. I've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
61,linard,October 2002,"While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, I'll paste the link. As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.  The fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute's listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. While I don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn't trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.  And while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change. However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class."
62,merc1,October 2002,Speaking of Mercedes and safety. I think this wrecked S430 says it all:  http://germancarfans.zeroforum.com/zerothread?id=1698   M
63,merc1,October 2002,Note how the cabin is completely in tact. Amazing.  M
64,wishnhigh1,October 2002,"I have seen 3 Mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents.  One of the rollover accidents was an S430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.  The third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road. I didnt see the drivers, but I saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.  Im generally dont praise late model Mercedes', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. They also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
65,sphinx99,October 2002,"I'll say it up front, I don't think Edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews. I understand the whole ""they're in BMW's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing. This month's letters to the editors & Edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.  Unfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. I'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.  Is this happening? Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster? Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura's is bottom. Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?  Not that only Acura gets the shaft either. In 2001 BMW got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the TL-S. In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features. This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.  Basically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?  In one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.  Until then, I'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.  Front seat comfort 2001: Acura 83, BMW 83 2002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6  Rear seat comfort 2001: BMW 74 Acura 70 2002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8  Conclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."

About seat comfort, my theory is seats are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seats can run off track. Who knows.

69,linard,October 2002,"I can personally vouch for the excellent performance of Benzes in collisions, my mom had a gray market 1981 500 SL that was broadsided at a perfectly 90 degree angle to her car at 40 - 50 miles an hour. She walked away with no serious injuries, just some muscle tension and whiplash. The other car was totalled and although the side of the car was basically crushed in, the passenger compartment's space was maintained. In addition, the door would still open and close normally and she was able to, amazingly, drive it home. I remember how thick the doors on the ""Dallas"" era SL's were, amazing... Took 30,000 to fix it and even then, it was never the same. We also had a 1987 420 SEL that was rear ended by a Pontiac Bonneville at approx 25 mph and the Pontiac's front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels. Our Benz, on the other hand, suffered little more than scrapes along the length of the bumper, but no structural damage, the bumper wasn't even displaced at all. Just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning..."

71,sphinx99,October 2002,"""Just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning...""  Of course, it goes both ways. Many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 Ford Taurus that I loved to death, I was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new Mercedes E-class. He had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent. In contrast, my Taurus was destroyed--I was slammed into a Buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed. To the dearly departed Taurus's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and I only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the Benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work. I'll never forget the Mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while I stared at my utterly destroyed car.  On a more positive note, that was the last Ford I ever owned. Whew!  In conclusion: Mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well. If I were looking to take out Dodge Neon drivers, literally, I'd pick a S500 as my instrument of mayhem. If you're looking to drive while combing your hair, talking on the cell phone and changing radio stations at the same time, but do not want to sit in a Ford Expedition, then an E-class may be for you!"

And as riez points out is has LSD. Infiniti G35 - Stripper version almost the least expensive of the bunch. Lincoln LS - I would question the reliability of these.

The 5-series by comparison has more upscale features, and with good negotiations you can get one for a hair over $40K. There are no absolutes and people have their own opinions. But to me the cars discussed here are all in class."
86,riez,October 2003,"Strongly believe the segmentation should be based on what is actually paid. Not on inflated MSRPs. This is really a sign of what the market thinks is the real value of the car.  Think the heart/meant of this segment is around $27,500-32,500. With the fringes at $25,000-27,500 and $32,500-35,000. A car with an MSRP of $40,000-$44,000 that actually sells for around $35,000 really is in this segment. Lincoln (LS), Cadillac (CTS), Infiniti (M45) and some others heavily discount their cars.  This would cover everything from Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima, Jag X-type 2.5, MB C230, and 300M (at the low end) and the 330i, 525i, Jag X-type 3.0 & C320 (at the high end) with a ton of cars in the middle. Leaves cars like CTS6, LS6, and IS300 in the middle.  Jag X-type a great example. Easy to see MSRPs of the 3.0 over $40,000. But Jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move. And for 2004, Jag lowered the base price of the 3.0 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of ""free"" standard equipment. The market spoke what this car was worth!"
87,kdshapiro,October 2003,"Not to pick nits, but didn't you in anotherpost above somewhere suggest cars should be compared MSRP to MSRP? Here you are doing an apparent flip-flop."

89,riez,October 2003,"kdshapiro... I've always tried to base a purchase decision on what I can buy a particular car for and how much I think it will cost me to own. MSRP is an important consideration, more so for those marques that can charge at or near MSRP. But the reality of a specific purchase decision has to take into account the actual money that will change hands, both now and in the long haul.  Remember the old G35 vs 3 Series debate? I always mentioned BMW CCA discount for members, long-term resale value, value of free maintenance, etc. Others raised ED price. I also included CPO. When G35 first came out, there was a limited supply and it was hot to market (with dealers not moving much off MSRP, though that has certainly changed now) compared to the readily-available E46 3 Series (that came out as MY99). Just looking at MSRPs didn't do justice to the cost analysis.  Of course, since discounts may vary by region, time of year, etc., MSRP always has to be an initial starting point."
90,qbrozen,October 2003,"not only do discounts vary by region, time of year, etc, but they vary by buyer. Comparing what YOU could get 2 different cars for can be completely different than what I could get 2 different cars for. Just because your local BMW dealer gives you $10K off car X doesn't mean I could do the same or vice versa. So comparing what cars ""sell for"" is extremely difficult. The only way I've seen to do something like this fairly is to use an online buying service where the prices are available to the public (like carsdirect or similar) or to strictly use TMV here on edmunds."

97,chrisboth,November 2003,"The volvo is fast off the line - but IMO its a turbo vs NA thing which I believe all else equal you take the NA. People who ahve driven the Volvo have said that it's very fast but not quite a sports sedan and doesn't feel as planted as a G or 3.  To mod the G you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350Z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the G the G guys do what the Z guys innovate. Cold Air intake, Pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble. ECU upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ECU retard them by defaukt are available as well.  PS a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ECU flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan. I think you could get to 13.9 with all the above. NA baby  Some or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things. Much more mods I think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come. There are some serious enthusiast in G forums out there too. Check em out"
98,qbrozen,November 2003,"ECU chip or reflash, exhaust, and intake.  with the R you'd probably be up to around 340-350 hp with modest mods like that. With the G35 its tougher to say, but maybe you could get it up to 275-285 (if a chip is available) without getting into the big money mods.  Probably the biggest advantage of the R aside from AWD is the 4C suspension. I really don't know why anyone would say it doesn't feel as planted when all reviews I've read state that you would NOT want to use the Advanced setting on the R unless you were on a track. Sounds pretty planted to me. But I haven't driven both cars, so take that for what its worth."

103,raher,January 2004,"I looked at buying a BMW 330i when I was looking at the 04TL. I bought the new TL ( auto with NAV ) because the equivelant features on the BMW were $10K more. Everything was ""extra"". I am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the TL in the twisty parts of the road ( but by how much?). Then again even after paying many extra $$$ for the performance package..the 330i is still down 35hp to the TL. I used to road race motorcycles and if I only had a buck for every time I passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp. How many of you actually drive your cars hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the RWD on the 330i ? Many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow. I'll take the $10G's and the 35hp and the stereo and the NAV and on and on and on."
104,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""( but by how much?). ""???  That is exactly the question. When you plunk down $35K for a TL when you can get a perfectly acceptable Hyundia for $12K, you start to ask yourself, is the extra $23K worth it. Is the TL over 3000% better? Of course it isn't. You just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out -because there is something that can't be used that cost money in the other item, but people can't take advantage of it.  That is the whole value equation in life. For me, either I'll get the Hyundia and pocket the $23K difference, or I'll spring for the extra $10K."

Why not spring for an extra $20,000 and get a 5 Series Sedan, or another $35,000 and get a 7 Series, or an Audi A8. And, if you don't want to spring for the extra cash, then why did you buy the 3 Series in the first place, just buy the Hyndia you keep talking about."

108,saugatak,January 2004,"don't get into a debate with kd on value because to him, if you're not spending the money to drive a bmw, you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai.  i don't think there's any right answer on value. bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things, then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it.  if prestige does not matter to you and you're happy with a car which handles 90% as well as a BMW, then clearly it's not worth it to get the BMW.  everyone's value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of cars. if i'm making $50 million a year, i don't care about a $10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else (it's less than 1% of my net worth) and i'll get what i want. if i'm making $50k a year, that extra $10k represents a much greater portion of my income (20% of my net worth) and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20% better.  frankly, i'm sick and tired of the FWD vs. RWD debate. i have driven a ton of both FWD and RWD cars and just b/c a car is RWD doesn't mean it automatically drives better than a FWD car. Mercedes for example makes a pretty fine car, and it's RWD, but most Benzes I have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars (Please note that I have not driven every model Benz, just going by personal exp. so no need to flame me for above statement).  For example, I had to drive my cousin's ML320 this weekend to get more food for my New Year's Party (his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available).  Well the seats and the sound system in the ML320 were great. The stiff steering, the sway in turns, and lack of feel on the road were awful. I hit double curves at 70 MPH in that ML320 to test it out and came out thinking, hmmm, this was a bad idea. The ML320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my Acura MDX, but in terms of handling, my FWD MDX kicks the RWD ML320."
109,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""Please tell us the story one more time, about how the TL is a communist plot to overthrow this country, and the ES is our performance(?!?!) sedan savior.""  I'm not advocating any one car, because I think they are both excellent cars for the individual who wants to purchase them.  I do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x, when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway you'll never use all of car x's ability. That's all well and good but you have to add the four little letters: IMHO. Who is anybody to suggest to ME, how I should spend MY money and whether a particular car is worth it to ME and whether I will or won't derive any added benefit for paying more? This train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles.  That being said, sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right. And a point in time either can satisify your requirements.  saugatak - this is not a BMW thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with BMW. I am very familiar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right. They offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers. There is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another. If there were, a manufacturer wouldn't be able to give their vehicles away."

111,kdshapiro,January 2004,"saugatak - I am going to respectfully suggest you are missing the point of this whole thing and in the course of not understanding the point you call people argumentative. It is not about, which car is better because every car has it's compromises. And after all it is not you that is financing my car, it's me. It is about what is the best car for me. The ES and TL, as every other vehicle each have it's plus and minus and I'm going to make a decision based on what I believe is the right choice for me. Doesn't matter what CR, JD Power, Edmunds, you or anybody else says."
112,shenkar,January 2004,"""Most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying.""  Yeah...but only if you take him seriously. Why would any thinking individual do that???"
113,kdshapiro,January 2004,"As far as the RWD vs FWD debate, to some people it makes a big difference, for whatever the reason is to a particular person. A BMW 3 series, like the TL, like the ES is not a ""one size fits all"". It depends on what one considers a priority in the vehicle they are purchasing. There is no one ""rightly"" engineered vehicle."

115,saugatak,January 2004,"shenkar: LOL  kdshapiro: KD, YOU are the only person missing the point so let me spell it out for you.  You continually go around demanding that everyone respect your choice of car, but you show absolutely no respect for any other person's choice of car--unless of course that person chooses a BMW.  You continuously make fun of the TL, you say that you prefer the looks of a Lexus ES330 over a TL but you also like the looks of the pre-Bangle and post-Bangle BMWs but don't like the look of Pontiac Grand Ams (real headscratcher), you keep saying if you're not getting a BMW buy a Hyundai, you say the criticism of Consumer Review is worthless because it ranked the TL over the BMW (I didn't notice any such criticism when the BMW was ranked above the TL), I mean this list is endless.  The only consistent theme in your wildly inconsistent statements is BUY BMW (do you own shares?). You keep talking about your objectivity but I don't see it.

116,riez,January 2004,"There really isn't any comparison between FWD and RWD. They may both generate similar track numbers, though even that is unlikely, but they will do it in an entirely different way. When you put 60% or thereabouts of weight up front and have the drive wheels do the steering, you will get a different driving experience.  As for value, the IS300 manual is the sleeper. You get near 330i performance, luxury, and equipment for 325i price. Not to mention reliability, warranty, customer service, etc."
117,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""you say the criticism of Consumer Review is worthless because it ranked the TL over the BMW ""  I don't know what CR said, since the only issue I have is the 2004 Auto Guide. In that issue CR said something like the Accord is almost as good as the 2004 TL for $5K less.  And I'll say it again, unabashedly...if you want the best driving dynamics the 3-series is the benchmark. The 3-series isn't for everyone just like the TL isn't for everyone, but it is the benchmark in the entry level luxo sports sedan market.  You have to choose the vehicle that you feel comfortable with. Everything else you said in your post is garbage."

119,kominsky,January 2004,"When I was car shopping in the early 90's, I had just been blessed with my first child and was, accordingly, shopping for my first ""family"" car. CR had a shootout involving the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. The Accord, according to them, had better road feel, better acceleration, better brakes, better handling, etc (they labelled it the ""driver's car"" of the comparison). The Camry, on the other hand, was quieter, had better trunk access, was slightly larger (if I remember correctly), etc. The Camry won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others. (FWIW, I ended up with an Altima, but that was based on a financial decision above all else... for as reliable as it was, I never really liked that car).  Anyway, I think CR is an excellent source of, mostly, objective info. The buyer has to decide what is most important for their driving style and lifestyle, take the appropriate cars out for a test-drive and then choose accordingly."
120,kdshapiro,January 2004,braking - sorry the 70 to 0 braking of 189 reported in C & D was not the best numbers. I guess if you keep the TL at sixty even your golden.  engines - BMW has a 3L NA engine that puts out 400+ horsepower. But unfortunately we'll never see it.
121,kdshapiro,January 2004,"A new 2004 Accord drove up into my driveway last night. It had all the goodies, sat/nav etc. Out the door price was a little over $28K. The TL with nav is about $35K. After tooling around in this vehicle I realized the only reason that people would go for the TL at $7K more or the TSX which is a four-banger is the ""so-called"" prestige factor of the Acura brand.  You could never derive the additional $7K in driving benefit from a TL. And it beats the TSX hands down. For the price/feature content this car beats 'em all. Of course it is FWD and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable Honda, with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train.  After thinking about it I can see why there might be some people who don't want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned. It's because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money. I can now see that, as I believe when you buy a TL with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped Accord. You are actually paying more money to get less car.  While I really wanted an X3 due to the NE climate, I might have to reverse myself and say the Honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck (even though it has torque steer and fwd) and save myself $12 grand, which I can use towards my kids college education or home improvements."
122,riez,January 2004,"For those who love numbers, compare performance and price numbers for cars like the Neon SRT-4 and Sentra SE-R Spec V. Ensure you add the available performance options like LSD to SRT-4 and the Brembo brake package to the Spec V. Then compare these cars, which cost around $20,000, to the 330i or TL. That SRT-4 will run (run over?) the TL or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process. But is it a legitimate comparison?  Price to performance is not the only way to go nor even always a relevant comparison."
123,pg48477,January 2004,"kd, People buy TL over Accord, for the same reason you bought your 330 over 325.  riez, Those two cars you mentioned have no luxury factor, if I would settle for something like that I would get WRX Sti or Evolution 8.  zumbalak, looks like you have a lot of experience driving RWD, that is why you had few scary moments driving FWD TL, you dont drive FWD the way you drive RWD. I for example had a few scary moments driving G35 coup 6mt, bacouse I'm not use to pushing RWD to the limit, I even span once."
124,riez,January 2004,"pg48477... You prove my point. If luxury is the primary criteria, then why are people obsessing about performance numbers? And if price/value is the primary criteria, then there are a lot ""better"" less expensive cars out there.  And that leaves us the dilemma of this board: What does it mean to be a ""near luxury performance sedan""? Are luxury and performance equal? Or is performance more important than luxury? Or vice versa?  I firmly believe in performance taking precedence, but not at the expense of luxury. And other factors like reliability, warranty, customer service, operating costs, etc. cannot be left out of the equation.  But if you don't define terms and weight what is important, all you do is debate apples and oranges? Or Granny Smith apples vs. Red Delicious apples?"
125,kdshapiro,January 2004,"There have been some recent posts suggesting the TL is overall best value. By whose yardstick are we measuring? And what is the factual criteria?  1. number of goodies 2. size of backseat 3. driving experience 4. hp and torque 5. oveall performance numbers 6. cost and financing 7. drivetrain  What are the soft criteria?  1. looks of vehicle 2. estimated resale value in x years 3. quality/luxury of interior 4. manufacturer reputation 5. dealer reputation 6. supposed value of automobile (note hard value goes up as total cost decreases, but soft value is based on the compromises one finds in the automobile. For example a Hyundai has a lot of hard value, but to some people not a lot of soft value. Is hard value or soft value more important?)  One size doesn't fit all."
126,pg48477,January 2004,"For me performance is important, but money is also important. For example I would not pay 10K+ more for 330 over TL for only marginally better handling, but worse power train. On the other hand I would pay 20+ more for M3 which has way better handling and way better powertrain."
127,pg48477,January 2004,"You finally answered your Huyndai question. Both are important and TL would be had to had with 330. If you compare everything you just said, assuming that TL and 330 cost the same , we probably would have a tie. But being that TL cost 10K less, we now know who the winner is:)"
128,saugatak,January 2004,"Think that's a topic for another board, but I don't think anyone can argue that v6 Camry or v6 Accord (will refer to them as CamCord from now on) give you best bang for buck. Yes, you can get a lower brand car but the CamCord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  With respect to the price differential between a nav-Accord and a nav-TL, I agree the nav-Accord wins in the value equation, but from what I've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the Acura's nav system is a lot better. I have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (I find a $20 map/atlas that I can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so I don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the TL allows you to say ""Phone Home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped Accord.  Now this may seem silly to you but I kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:  1) I never use a cell phone when driving (unless I'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone I'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful. Time is money and if I can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the Nav system on the TL could pay for itself. Also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.  2) One of my favorite shows as a kid was Knight Rider (in spite of David Hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving Cylon eye was just so cool. There is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.  3) If I buy the TL, it'll be the 6MT so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.  The point is although objectively the nav-Accord beats the nav-TL, I think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior Acura nav./voice system.  With respect to the current generation v6 Accords, I found that Honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. Accord. To me, they have the driving feel of a Camry and frankly, the Camry is a better Camry than the Accord is. When you compare prices on the non-nav Accord v6 and non-nav TL, I think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that I could get the Accord for $600 over invoice and the TL for $2k under MSRP based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).  I think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav Accord to non-nav TL. Also, I really want a 6MT and unfortunately the Accord sedan does not come in 6MT and v6. I'd have to get the Accord 6MT v6 Coupe.  And my wife's response when I suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the Accord 6MT Coupe was: ""I always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""  Well I like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way I'm gonna do it so it's the TL for me."
129,saugatak,January 2004,"I don't normally defend kdshapiro, but I really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.  It's kind of hard to compare the TL to any BMW b/c pricewise it's closer to the 3-series but sizewise it's comparable to the 5-series.  If you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twisty roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's BMW. Also as someone who drove a 3-series in his 20s, I have to say that I had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car I've had before or since.  I think if you exclude the 2 factors I mentioned above, the TL whomps the BMW 3-series, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the MasterCard commercial, PRICELESS.  OK, I think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully I haven't offended any women."
130,pg48477,January 2004,"TL is right in between 5 and 3 in size, plus its being considered Near Luxury Performance Sedan.  Everybody have their own opinion on any subject, but consideration by majority puts thing in perspective.  I also place a high premium on being able to get of the corner by accelerating hard, and I believe FWD is better in this department."
131,kennyg5,January 2004,"Your post is interesting in that you are arguing with yourself, at times, as to what is a better ""value"" - the Accord or TL.  As many of us have noted, although value is relative, it may also be measured objectively. However, even this objectively quantifiable factor may be viewed subjectively, depending on the viewer's wealth, dispositions and priorities in life, spending habits ... and not to mention the proverbial ""ego"" or ""status"" factor. As to the last factor, people seem quite touchy -- defensively and offensively :-)"
132,kennyg5,January 2004,"""OK, I think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully I haven't offended any women.""  I would be more careful if I were you, because I am not sure whether our revered host ""Pat"" is Patrick or Patricia :-)"
133,kahunah,January 2004,...the Knight Rider car was a Pontiac Firebird not a Corvette. Perhaps the show's producers felt that the Firebird offered better value.
134,riez,January 2004,"pg48477... You write, ""For example I would not pay 10K+ more for 330 over TL for only marginally better handling, but worse power train."" But you can say the exact same thing, only even worse, for the Accord V6 vs TL. They are siblings from the same company. Thus, if you can't say it for the Accord, you can't logically say it for the 330i."
135,riez,January 2004,"We always end up apples to oranges because we can't agree on even the most basic of things. For example, what is the relevant price spread? Is it under $40K? Over $25K but less than $45K? For me, I think the ""meat"" of this market segment is in the $27,500-$32,500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least $25K but no more than $35K. But notice how subjective everything is?  Thus, for me, the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one, not a loaded one. The loaded ones and the 330i with Perf. Pkg push $40K. To me, $40K is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan. There ain't no ""near"" at $40K. That is why I went with a loaded IS300 manual for approx. $32,500 MSRP when a similar 330i was nearly $40K. For $32,500 MSRP I could get a decently equipped (but just) 325i but not a 330i. (And I don't want to bring in ED issue.)  Wish we had three boards. One for FWD, one for AWD, and one for RWD. For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" FWDer. That is an oxymoron. And I wouldn't want the weight penalty that AWD brings.  And, staying purely, subjective, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" car with an automatic transmission. So these discussions would only be covering cars not controlled (dominated) by slushboxes. ""Performance automatic"" is also an oxymoron."
136,kahunah,January 2004,The IS300 is simply no match for any model TL (automatic or manual) in all categories.

140,ltmarks,January 2004,"hello everyone, I test drove both a Honda accord coupe, EX V6 with nav and the 325xi yesterday.  It's very interesting to me that the accord popped up a few times in this thread about near luxury cars.  I must say that the 240hp accord seemed more powerful than the BMW, with only marginally worse handling. granted I was not on a race track, but this is everyday driving.  I also must say that this accord had every possible option and is $4,000 cheaper than the BMW that has almost no options (not even power seats!) I was amazed that you could actually talk to the navigation system.  Finally, I was amazed at how plush the honda was and how spartan the BMW was. the BMW was almost embarassingly uncomfortable on the inside.  All this being said, can anyone really justify goping with the BMW here? Also, can anyone justify spending $4k more for the Acura TL.  Maybe go for the BMW because of 1) all wheel drive and 2) prestige of driving a BMW?  Please let me know, Thank you."
141,pg48477,January 2004,"I dont understand why is that Saab does not count, because it stepped on your toes. We are talking about stock cars without any additions from after market, hey Saab does not have 3.0 V6 like IS does.  riez and kd, I wonder how far you two push you RWD cars. I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars. With that said do you really know your cars limits, I bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is. In order to compare RWD and FWD you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit, and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night. I don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. While 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over TL in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it. As for IS, in my opinion it does not even handle as good as TL, so just leave it a that."
142,kdshapiro,January 2004,"pp...it was written tongue in cheek...forgot the smiley...:)  But to answer the question, I push the car pretty darn hard. I don't drive to smash 'er up or to race it, but the predictable response, smooth drivetrain and communicative steering let's me do almost anything. Now could a professional push it harder, absolutely.  Honda Accord V6 to a BMW 325 for $28,000. To me it's no contest, the Honda is very nice at that price. I never go for loaded cars, but there is a certain level of options that I want. A $28,000 BMW does not have it. Having just driven a loaded Honda Accord, I can say it drives very nicely. Could I see myself driving it? Absolutely? Does it handle anywhere close to my 330i. Not a chance. But if the sport in sports sedan doesn't matter, it's a compelling choice.  ""I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars.""  Me too, including a 911.  ""So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. While 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over TL in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it.""  pp - I agree. If you're idea of handling is to plow threw snow with all-seasons a FWD will outdo a RWD. But I can feel the difference between a great FWD and a great RWD. It is no contest. Does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets. No. But that is not what this conversation is about, or else we would all be driving Hyundais (sorry shenkar that's the last of it). A great RWD will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great FWD, because of the balance and power delivery. As I said it doesn't make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets, but that is not what this conversation is about. What drive-train one chooses is a personal preference. They each have their advantages and limitations.  But let's not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road."

RWD with traction control is great for 60% of the country and the rest will be offered AWD or ATEESA type systems.  The argument that FWD is a good decision isn't invalidated yet neither can you say that it's hype that gets people demanding RWD cars. Balance is not just weight distribution..it's also which way the weight shift when you floor it. RWD is not bad - in fact it's merit's, I believe, and not hype got it on the comeback trail.

Specifically the 3-series though. It's ironic above $40K there is not a lot of competition in the FWD space. Aside from the Acura RL, what other vehicle is FWD? The IS is a competitor and was not overlooked. However, I still think the styling of the IS300 is racer-like and not really world class. That would keep me from getting it (although riez loves his).

I currently own both FWD and RWD vehicles, and I love them all. They all do exactly what I need them to do. So does that mean that my RWD Mercedes sedans are superior to my '04 FWD Nissan Quest van? Certainly not based on drivetrain configuration alone.  There are a very few situations where one or the other will clearly be preferrable, but in most other situations they will be interchangable. I just don't believe there are absolutes when discussing the average driver, on the average road here in America. And I'd be so bold as to say that includes every single one of us (unless you reside in Nevada or Utah or the like).  We're fundamentally arguing our preferences and prejudices, in the main, and I don't see the need for that since they both are valid in MOST situations."

You dont have to go to Utah to enjoy the dynamics. There may be no merit in arguing which is better F or R drive but there is no way you can say a RWD car is never enjoyed or worth it or needed. The cars may be interchangable most of the time if you want to get there but the desirable charachteristics of RWD are there to enjoy all the time and the preference is more than fluff."

Value should, by definition, take all aspects of the purchase into account, including capabilities. Weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value.  So I say again, the TL is a better VALUE because it is closer in CAPABILITY to the 330 than the Accord is to the TL. In other words, the $7K price hike to get the TL over the Accord nets you MUCH greater results than the $7K price hike (although its even more than that!) to get the 330 over the TL. I let the numbers of the TL versus the 330 that all you Bimmer-owners/lovers speak for themselves. I don't have the time to sit here and set up a 3-way chart for ya."

Actually, the $7K to get from the Accord to the TL doesn't get you $7K worth of benefit toward the Bimmer. In fact, in the TL it may get you marginally closer to handling on the Bimmer, but not $7K worth. But the fact the Bimmer has performance handling characteristics neither car can match.

Either way I'd still rather be stuck in my 3-series than any other vehicle.""  My point is that in the real world RWD has its limitations. In cases of snow, FWD has the advantage. As for AWD SUVs, that's the biggest joke. You would not believe how many SUVs get towed out of snow banks and ditches in Toronto after a snow storm -- way too many. I've been driving FWDs in snow for 14 years and never, ever got stuck.  As for being stuck in traffic, if your car is not moving RWD offers no advantages. And, I rather be in a car with the world's best factory stereo system for any length of time."
175,kdshapiro,January 2004,"You're back to the environment of the car, rather than the abilities of the car. A RWD with 4 snows will handle just as well as a FWD with snow. A RWD with all-seasons will be outhandled by a FWD.  kahuna - you're logic is the very reason, that most every driver in an urban area ought to be driving Hyundais. Yet it's not happening. BTW, from everything I've heard and read, unless the TL has dvd-audio the stereo is nothing special. (I don't know first hand) I'd rather be listening to an ML anyday. If I can't do that, I'd rather drive the Bimmer. Anyway since we're talking about unused capabilities, why don't you drive a Honda Accord and save yourself $7K, if you are sitting in traffic. You have unused capabilities, especially with the inbound Toronto traffic in the morning.$4K for a good aftermarket stereo along with a Honda could still save you money over a TL."
176,chrisboth,January 2004,"As for AWD SUVs, that's the biggest joke  They owners are a joke. FWD is not as capable as AWD there can't be argument here can there be...? Perhaps the AWD owners should learn how to drive and recognize that AWD doesn't make for better stopping.  While FW is almost as good as all wheel it is not better.  And I see tons of SUV's that people in CO seem to put off road in snow banks and medians all the time - THEY ARE ALL 4 WHEEL DRIVE NOT AWD...huge difference. People dont go into 4wd when they should and leave it 2 wheels usually rear."

178,chrisboth,January 2004,I've heard the stereo first hand and the DVD is great but for regular CD's - it's on par with the bose system from the G35. ITs good even really good but no better.  TL has a great interior - one of the best. But the car is not a top line sports sedan by virtue of the limitations that several editors and testers have all consistently harped it for. FWD. There is little else to know once these facts are revealed to RWD fans. Its on deaf ears.
179,qbrozen,January 2004,"No, sorry, I have no idea what you mean.  but, honestly, i'm not trying to knock anyone's choice. I'm just trying to defend what I found to be a great car (referring to the TL). And if the only advantage that can be stated for buying the BMW over the TL is that extra .5 G of roadholding ability, that's just not going to pursuade me to fork over all that extra money. And, according to C&D, even the Accord coupe you are fond of mentioning is faster in the quarter mile than the 330 with performance pack.  But there is so much more to consider aside from numbers. The TL is quieter, quicker, better handling, more solid, better shifter, better clutch, better interior materials, etc. over the Accord. I can't say all that regarding the BMW."
180,qbrozen,January 2004,"The Legacy GT is another one I'm looking forward to. But I'd be surprised if it bests the others. It will probably be faster in a straight line with a tall clutch dump, but on a track they will be much closer. Unless Subaru finally puts a real sporting suspension on a non-STi product, its not going to be very tossable."

I expect it to be a solid car but I doubt 3/G lovers are weeping just yet. 250 HP spread to 4 wheels is about what an a-4 is...fun but no M5."
182,buddhabman,January 2004,"If you review the few mag articles that relate specifically to the GT, they mention how balanced the handling is. The rub has always been the lack of power, and the interior refinement."

Yes you'll lose the race, but I'm sure you will think, look at that guy in the cheap modded American car, compared to my fancy A-spec TL."

185,chrisboth,January 2004,Thats more like it..400 hp is the benchmark - I hope everyone has an offering with that in mind. It will come down to pricing if these makers can really produce what they say they are..pretty comparable cars...the car that we Infiniti enthusiast long await is called Skyline-GTR and it will have near 500 hp for a speculated 55k or so and look like a cross between a G and a bugatti and a viper. The 2006-2008 car shopping seasons should be interesting for us.  Lets not forget that these are more sports cars than sports sedans. Hopefully I'll be in the minivan by then toting kids around. I'd love to have a 1986 caravan and a GTR for myself and the M5 or a tuaras for the finacee'.
186,speedracer3,January 2004,"Sorry riez, but the IS300 is the only Lexus that actually looks and feels like a regular Toyota. After sitting in the interior for five minutes one thing came to mind ""Corolla"". I am sure it handles great and all that, but the interior IMO the interior is major turnoff. Ok, maybe I am spoiled, but after driving an Audi for almost a year I've become what you call a ""dash-stroker""."
187,chrisboth,January 2004,I sat in the audi my not quite father in law just bought and All I could think was Volkswagen. Which by the way is not bad considering the passat interior is one of the most refined even out of its own class. While the interior was nicer in the audi it made me bored. G may not have the warm simple perfection of the Audi...but it's not boring at all. Perhaps I enjoy chaos.

But then again, I'm NOT looking for fake wood trim, ""warm"" brown interiors, etc. I want only black interior and prefer aluminum/chrome trim piece interiors.  The IS300 has beautiful ""drilled"" pedals and the interesting chronograph instrument cluster. The IS300 has one more legitimate gauge than either the 323ia or 540i6.  The IS300 is a boy racer interior. Serious interior for serious fun! What more could you want out of an interior? Luxury? Not me!  (My wife was always mad about the 323ia. It lacked the chrome doorsill plate like the 540i6. The 3 Series is just decent interior wise.)"
189,speedracer3,January 2004,"BMW interiors certainly have the material quality you would expect out of a luxury car, but the styling itself is austere. IMO, a bit boring. The G35 is fine ergonomically, but the quality of some of the plastics is poor for a luxury car. The IS300 has a boy racer look that not everybody cares for, some of the materials are Toyota not Lexus quality and I don't care for that chronograph speedo and such. Audi interiors are not always ergonomically sound (putting a cupholder over the stereo comes to mind), but the quality of plastics is incredible, also there is so much attention to detail and style that it is a pleasure to sit inside day in and day out."
190,kahunah,January 2004,"riez - I'm glad you enjoy your IS300 so much but you've got to come clean. How did you justify owning a car in this class range that gets SUV type fuel mileage (18/25)?

Yes, my vehicle gets 32 mpg on the open road, even tooling along at a good rate. I usually get 24-26 in city driving. CR validates the 32, which I find amazing.

197,cybersol,January 2004,"Thanks riez for the CR info on the G35. The G35 in that test is also lacking the sport package with the nicer tires and tighter suspension.  As for fuel economy, despite technological advancement, performance and economy are fundamentally opposite objectives. And gas is cheap compared to the total cost of this class of cars.  As an owner of none of these, but a long time shopper, my opinion on the best for each function.  Exterior Design: All good, all different Interior Design: A4, TL, C-Class Size/Space: G35 and TL Acceleration: BMW, G35, TL Braking: all very similar Handling: BMW, G35, IS300 Cost: Similar except the 330i, C-Class cost more Reliability: Japanese better than European  For me personally, Acceleration, Handling, Size, and Cost are more important than the interior, so if I were shopping for a sedan it would lead me to the G35.  But I am looking for a convertible, and I can't have a manual because my significant other will not budge on that issue. All that leads me to a 330Cic with SMG.  Have fun and remember they are all nice cars, depending largely on what you want most."

Even then I've had many people ask me if the 330i is my car as I'm loading things into it and such. Guess my usual weekend dishevled appearance doesn't jive with the concept of a bimmer owner.  Shirt with holes, unshaven, barely brushed hair and frayed/worn shorts/jeans fits my usual weekend look.  BTW, someone mentioned paying cash for gas. That's just silly. Credit cards give you cash back and or rewards for using them. Using the card is free, the expenses will be incurred anyway, so why not get something for your expenditures? I use cash as little as possible because the return on cash is nothing but the product.  Lastly, I'd agree with KD. I've wanted a Bimmer since 98 when the current body/setup hit the streets.

213,raher,January 2004,Press releases ARE marketing. Ever seen a press release by an automobile manufacturer talking about how another car is better ? Acura could use the CR article in it's press release and Infiniti could use an article talking about the G35. Take them for what they are worth. They are worth the writers or the editors opinion. What really matters is are they selling the car. Acura is apparently selling the TL better than any of their previous TL's even without an endorsement from Automobile magazine. I would pay to see five people in a 3 series..it must look like one of those circus cars where all of the clowns get out of a very small car.

215,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""What really matters is are they selling the car.""  Isn't that the point. It doesn't matter for example, why people don't understand why BMW sells boat loads of their 3-series, just that they do. However, in the pursuit of automotive excellence the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion, than you or I debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle.  The reason I posted that information, is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the 3-series is a has-been, the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedans. This is not in one magazines opinions, but others as well. Looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the conversation.  Now you could go say you don't believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesn't have any value to you, or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedans better. I would more than agree. But you can't discuss sports or sporty sedans, while ignoring the obvious, which is the overall handling and not focus on one set of numbers."
216,riez,January 2004,"Pretty much anytime the automotive press (rightly) touts the 3 Series, they normally are talking about either the M3 (a most awesome car!) or non-M cars with (1) manual transmission and (2) Sport Package.  A 325i automatic without Sport Pkg is a rather expensive and somewhat mundane car. There is really nothing unique about it other than the marque badging. But it lacks those critical features (1) and (2) that create the ""difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely excellent.""  If you LOVE to drive there is only one way to get a 3 Series: Sport Package and manual transmission. All the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans.  And IF BMW was so serious about the love of driving and creating the true existential difference between good and excellent, where is LSD??? That speaks volumes. Only M3 and M5 have LSD. Does BMW think the other buyers aren't smart enough to figure it out? Or do they know something about their buyers that we don't?  But guess what percentage of 3 Series, esp. sedans, are sold with automatics? Bet it is at least 60 percent. And what percentage of 3 Series sedans have Sport Package? Doubt it is over 25 percent. And what percentage of sedans are both manual transmission and Sport Package? Doubt it is over 15 percent.  So the vast majority of 3 Series sedan owners must be willing to settle for a heck of a lot less than they could have purchased and could be driving?  kdshapiro... Forget what your 3 Series is. Automatic? Sport Pkg?"

Sorry riez gotta agree&disagree on this one at the same time. Practicality rears it ugly head here and I wouldn't drive a manual sitting in the traffic I sit in every morning. I do not have the luxury of an M3 as a weekend car at this point, so my non-manual non-sport equipped vehicle will have to do.  If that makes me a pretender so be it. If it makes chrisboth a pretender also, so be it. If the vehicle doesn't have LSD makes it a pretender, so be it.

219,riez,January 2004,"kdshapiro... You are kidding, right? You bring up the existential difference between good and excellent and then say: ""practicality rears it ugly head here...sitting in the traffic I sit in every morning""???  That may mean you have to have an automatic non-Sport Pkg but that does NOT mean that said car is ""excellent"". It is good. But it can't hold a candle to a manual Sport Pkg 330i. (Just compare the tires. And have you ever looked at the base tires on a 325i non-Sport? Garbage.)  While a great philosopher said ""Hell is other people"", he might have said ""Hell is being stuck in traffic."" NO car stuck in traffic is doing what it is meant to do. Provide driving pleasure. It is then just a mere vehicle.  If you sit a lot in traffic, buy 2 vehicles. Get yourself a Honda Civic 4-cyl for traffic and a Honda S2000 or Mazda Miata for fun. Might cost you as much as a loaded 330i."

I've seen it on the street and I've seen it in the mags. The G pulls hard and leaves many in awe in 3rd gear (i have 5at).  ""As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.""  No not in all instances but many still. 67 is great for a FWD'er. But since you quote edmunds above here are some other quotes - KDS will enjoy this..""For me, if I'm after a truly sporty sedan, I have to go with the BMW 3 Series"" That is from the editor in cheef after testing the new TL.  Since FWD is for many more than RWD this car should be fine for those folks - there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included. Driving dynamics are a serious issue in my book and only RWD covers all the performance bases. FWD is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front. They are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at Honda.  There were other comments on edmunds that the TL is great as long as you dont drive an accord first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less.  And again, why should the G without SP upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades. I still will take my chances in 5AT form against one on track and god knows i would in 6MT form. Lets see the G35 with a performance package and then we'll compare again.  Someone mentioned the G was shooting for the stars...dam right and getting there quickly - this is year #2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long. Keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as G the G is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i. But wait the G doesn't have that intangible no one can explain that only the 5 supposedly has...gremlins? Oh and much more dough and the propeller thingy"
221,raher,January 2004,"The main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the cars we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact. Edmunds didn't say their slalom test result for the TL was good for a FWD car..they said it was one of the fastest they had ever tested.. period. As to race track performance, one of the previous posts said it best...3 series and Integra battle it out for championships in SCCA racing in that class. Your opinion of the G35 is no substitute for facts. Stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the G35 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example. What tests , where. I am sure the G35 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the TL. I stand by my original statement..you can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance. The differences are in 1/10's of a second. Having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured. Gearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. Having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end. I know the G35 is a great car. I would have bought the coupe but my wife couldn't live with two doors. That doesn't mean it is the end all $30K to $40K sedan however as you keep insisting in your posts."
222,kdshapiro,January 2004,chris - my take is that you would be very eager to own an EVO. This is the car with uncompromising performance.
223,danny1878,January 2004,"quoted from Car and Driver Magazine, in a preview test of the new TL, estimated a 0-60 time of six seconds flat. 0-60 6.00 secs C&D 1/4 mile accelaration 14.88 secs/100.8mph Car engine Chris is right, 0-60 can go to anyone at anygiven days. But 0-100 I havent seen a lot of them, just 2 article.  TL'04 will start opening those electric spool valve starting on 4700 rpm. that translates into a broader torque curve and significant peak power.--quoted from carguide magazine.  Since this TL is new, some data is not available and many hasnt tested it yet. Lets wait.  I cant even test it my self, too much snow out there. Cant wait but I dont want to make it muddy yet.  Some article said New TL tuned with A-Spec will get 300+ hp, is it true?"
224,chrisboth,January 2004,"I would love to own an evo - 10 years ago. If the evo was comparable it would make sense to bring it up. If we are on this board can we not assume that everyone wants a performance entry lux sedan. You are suggesting that performance is very imprtant? You are right which is why IN CLASS I picked the G.  I am not in the market for a very well placed and put together econo box. Im in my 30's and dont want another car in the driveway.  Performance; looks; value; size; tortional rigidity; price; and class without tude, and service are my bullets for purchase.  This is why I turned down a great deal on an A6 - everything was there but performance - oh and the look was getting old and that actually made me not even negotiate further."
225,billyperks,January 2004,"Are you insane?  The G has NOTHING on the 540.  I am no Bimmer Fan but that 540 is one monster of a car, the G can't even get past the 330.  Weight or no weight the 540 is a Supreme Car to the G."
226,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""Weight or no weight the 540 is a Supreme Car to the G""  It's not 540 at this point it's 545."
227,riez,January 2004,"Quoting hp/l figure is completely misleading in our situation. You have to quote the actual hp as realized by the drive wheels! There are tons of efficiency losses. Some marques and models are better than others.  Real interesting figures are drivewheel HP/l, drivewheel HP/lb, the entire output curve based on drivewheel results, tire efficiency, gearing, and CD. Would be interesting to compare these.  Too bad manufacturers don't ever quote drivewheel HP! Anyone got a dyno?"
228,danny1878,January 2004,"I have to agree with billyperks about 540/545 but I dont agree G can't even past 330. But that's only from people that I know.  Some cars are faster than others eventhou they are the same type/model car. Just like my friend's RSX'02, with modified exhaust & intake etc. vs mustang GT but at top speed the rsult is different which hardly can be achieved in street drivings. The results are 2 tickets from IOWA states police. Mustang won.  How many passenger you have also make a difference during the test."
229,chrisboth,January 2004,"""I am no Bimmer Fan but that 540 is one monster of a car, the G can't even get past the 330.""  The 540 is great lets agree on that but as far as actual performance you need to realize what the G can do...and this is outperform a 540 until about 100mph - I've been there and many others have as well.  As far as the 330 comment you must not have read back very far - even the 330 owners concede much performance and hang thier hat on the intangible BMW is the best driving machine stuff while they admit things like ""yeah the G is faster so go get an evo if you want fast""  330i...puleeeeze - I think the RSX is faster than the auto 330. I'd rather a 325 which is a good value if you want the car and not all the performance - almost what the 330i offers in context of the lastest competition for Infinit and Acura"
230,chrisboth,January 2004,Hey everybody upgrades thier motors when someone in a class behind can keep up. It's aHP war and everyone can add displacement - i thought that went against your values KD - where they just add litres instead of something intangible??  Let's not forget they are not comparable and the price of a 545 is near 70k...and we are still comparing.
231,chrisboth,January 2004,"""Stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the G35 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.""  Example of what? You are suggesting the Acura is no differnt than a G in acceleration. I'd say show me any car in any compo with G where G loses in either stat. gearing, HP, Torque - they all add up to driving exctiement. If you are left behind then just take it for what it is without gearing excuses or some other anomoly I am supposed to have as an excuse as to why the VQ should not be the most respected engine in the 30k car classes."
232,billyperks,January 2004,"I understand the love you have for your car as shown in your numerous posts.   I have a TL Type S and not many cars I think can outrun me factory to factory and class for class.  Last summer a 540 straight out spanked me straight acceleration.  I know the car is in a differnt class but I thought I could have hanged around with him- NO SIR, HE PULLED AWAY EASILY.  If you really want to see how the G can go backwards quickly, go up against the 540.  Remember I warned you."
233,danny1878,January 2004,"260 lbs/ft that has to mean something on street drivings. G35 has been around longer than new TL, so there must have been a lot of test.  While TL has only been tested a couple times but the result is inconclusive. (All test are based on standard specification no A-Spec) 0-60 Edmunds says 6.5 secs Car and Driver says 6.0 secs An article that I forgot says 5.7 secs  0-100 by edmund nothing  1/4 miles Edmunds :14.9 secs Engine power says 14.88 Another article says 14.4 secs Above that only top speed test but that can hardly be achieved on street drivings."
234,chrisboth,January 2004,I've been there man! It was very even actually - which is my point. I even had the guy ask me what the F I was driving. I have plenty of BMW's in the circle of friends/fam. I know full well what the 5 is about.  The TL-S is much different than the new TL in gearing and motor and weight and CD. I think I'd expect the results you described for your car. Do you have an auto? Read the stats - none of the 04 cars mentioned (545 notwithstanding) are going to be THAT different really. My points about the G are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3. These differences are not very big but I will suggest they are consistent and in one direction.  That said I would expect the new TL to hang with a 540 pretty well. 6.2 is the 0-60 on 540 right guys?
235,danny1878,January 2004,"Anyway there is no exact comparo between G35, 330, TL, 540. 3.5l engine vs 3.0l engine vs 3.2l engine vs 4.0l engine. All car are good. Depends on who drive it. I used to race a bike Yamaha 250cc but since the accident, I would think twice about going all out. Lets drive safe guys."
236,raher,January 2004,"chris..it appears to me you are the one posting that the G can't be beat but don't have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car. Everyone gets left behind by someone. I am still not convinced that the G is going to consistently leave the other sedans behind since the data isn't out there yet to back up your opinion. That's what those multi car shootouts do. What will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow ? Yell at them that the G 35 is faster but the driver isn't ? There really isn't any point to continue to chant the G 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it. I am willing to admit that they are all nice cars and have different strengths and weaknesses. I am not willing to admit that any of the sedans being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others. As to the VQ being the most ""respected"" engine in the $30K class...respected by who..the owner of the car ? Respect isn't something I give to inanimate objects, respect is for people. All I hear is a bunch of bench racing."
237,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""respect is for people""  And as an aside, I believe prestige is for people, not tires."
238,chrisboth,January 2004,"Yes the preacher of 6 speeds. I've put my time in on a 5 speed to understand yout plight in conviving the world that the only cars worth buying are manual. You and KD can spar about that. I dont want to break up with my GF and dont want to sit in DC traffic for 3 hours pushing a clutch whenever I go to NC. If the car was slower by more than .2 seconds or handled less - I'd buy that swamp sale. Get over the manual tranny thing - it's old school now that SMG 8 and 9 speeds are on the drawing boards. Personally I hope that I'll always have the choice to go to personally engaging the clutch or not. You are preaching to someone who used to think that way...as far as troucning me - you'll have to be a much better driver and in our hypothetical world these cars are very even. 0-60 you can have if I can have 0-100.  0-60 is not a race - you can have your gearing designed to compete directly with the G and then I can get past you to 100 just like the stats show.  If someone needs me to prove it to them then I'll I have to do is simply READ BACK at all the freaking comps posted already - take a look at each one specifying a 0-100 and quarter. Find any car in class that beats G auto to auto or 6 to 6 and I will concede to you whatever you want. I've been there before and I thought most of you were already there with me.

You Lexus thing is a good idea except to date nothing in the lineup is impressive and I just heard the supra was going to be too expensive and they canned it for reasons similar to the first canning in the 90's. Not a lot of toyota R&D goes into FM type platforms or Sports cars. IT's all subject to change im sure.  ""A RWD Acura and better branded RWD Lexus, if done properly, would trounce the Z on the Japan Inc playing field. I hope Nissan is watching, because Lexus knows""  Now you are comparing to cars that don't exist yet...by the time those come off the drawing board - nissan will have the GTR out and and M45.

Present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7% is about $12,500."
242,kdshapiro,January 2004,"""Present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7% is about $12,500.""  Correct. That's why some people I know instead of buying Lexus, Infiniti, BMW buy Hyundai. Present value of $25,000 for 10 years is what? You don't have to skip buying a 540 to save money, you can skip buying Infiniti also and save a bundle. At the end, buy that M5 for cash.  Come on chris - People who are really serious about saving money, don't even buy cars over $10/$11K, much less buying a BMW or Infiniti."
243,chrisboth,January 2004,Come on KD - people who get the 5 get lux gooidies and granted SOME substance but not 12k worth IMO. If Hyundia puts up a G beater I'll be the first in line especially if it saves me money. I'd pay 25k for a loaded H-35 if it runs like G 35.

Just like my dad told me ""dont eat too much otherwise you will become fat"" so I wont eat at all. thats not gonna work.  You can buy any car which suited you best, compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it.  Some people prefer the best brand name in the market, some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand. Best brand name does not always come with more features, more luxury, better performance etc. Besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best.

G35 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of TL, I think that infiniti has a long way to go."
246,rderizans,January 2004,"FWIW, I've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement. What a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh? BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?  I just traded my 99 328i (E46) for a G35x. I absolutely loved the 328i, but the ABS pump went and I figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping. Before that, the car was rock-solid. Never a problem, really.  The G35x was just the best value for me out there. It's beautiful (IMHO, of course), has AWD, and a GREAT engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my BMW), while also giving me more room than my BMW. Oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although I don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.  I test-drove the Acura TL and it's a pretty amazing bargain. Didn't care for the FWD feel or the dealers in my area or I'd probably be driving one today. Interior is AMAZING. Puts Infiniti and BMW to shame. During my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the G35's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things. Cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.  Anyway, the BMW (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new G35x, but the G35x feels more powerful and rides better. Both are awesome cars.  One other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines. I love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges. For example, BMWs are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually Pilots). Most other cars are tested with all-season tires. Mention is rarely made of that difference. It certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results. In BMW's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap Turanza EL42s that came on my G35x.  Anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a BMW 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an Audi A4, Acura TL, and G35x, I can say that I honestly think I could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars. If Caddy can get their build-quality up I'm sure they will be another player. For those who don't think there's something special about a 3-series BMW, you really need to own one for a while. I fell in love and might very well find myself back in a BMW down the line. The g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.  Heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the Passat, Mazda6, Accord, Altima, and Camry!  Whatever you choose in whichever class, what a GREAT time to be car shopping!!!"
247,merc1,January 2004,""" I'm sure it was an auto and I'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad. Check another stat on the G and compare - 50-70 and 5-60 numbers are very good for the Z car platform. You guys may find value in many things about many cars - I find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class. ""  No problem with the latter part of this, about the G35, but the 540i surely isn't in the G's class, it's several classes above it, and in the hands of a skilled driver the G35 doesn't have a prayer with a 540i.  It really doesn't say much for the G to be compared to the Porsche 928, especially since the car was designed in the seventies. There used to be a website called http://www.4car.co.uk/ and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one you've made here. Before their demise they had a test in which the Audi S6 (Euro model only), XJR (pre 04) and M5 were competing with a used to be untouchable Ferrari, the 512TR, which started out as the Testarossa in the 1980's, and guess what...the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure. Point being that cars simply advance. I don't know what a 350Z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 GT3. I can mention a SL55 AMG in same breath as an Carrera GT in some areas, bit that doesn't mean the SL55 is comparable overall.  M"
248,chrisboth,January 2004,"""the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure""  I recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the G - but I'm stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement, but on lux items and ride quality. Hey I want an M5 as much as anyone..see some of my past posts. The Edmunds home page today has the G-35 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i - as well as the m5.  Whoever suggested infiniti has a long way - hello - FX35 and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less, upcoming m45 - which exists in japan now, things we aren't fortuante enough drive here like the Skylines and GTR's ...There's enough here to keep me happy.

249,merc1,January 2004,"I agree, performance does transcend classes, by my point is that if you're just looking for speed a Z28 SS will outrun all of the cars, G35, 540i etc, but it doesn't compare overall. The G35 is a hell of a car, of which the Coupe I will be considering, but compared to a 5-Series overall it's not in the same league. Just because Infiniti mentions the 5-Series and M5 as targets doesn't mean they've met those targets, imo and experience with both cars they've fallen short of a normal 5-Series overall and its too surreal to even think about a G35 competeing with a M5.

The C&D comparisons I've read tested the 330i with the G35 and IS300. Are you citing a recent comparison test? Or looking at different tests?

Cadillac will learn this with its V. Acura is trying with its new A-spec cars. Heck, even Saturn is trying with its Red Line! Shows you there is either money in them thar hills or they know the ""presitge"" turns into sales down or up the rest of the line."

I depends, I've always thrown out the JD Powers surveys, even though I have had some vehicles that in the end were super, and in the end were soup. I think if you have a problematic vehicle you have more of an axe to grind. In fact I asked a number of people recently how many JD Powers or CR surveys they ever submitted. The answer didn't surprise me. 0.  ""Are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise?""  I hope they are impartial. That's why I don't based a buying decision on a magazine article. It's just another data point. A first hand reference, others call them anecdotal evidence, means more than the article.  ""But you are still getting premium features for your dollars.""  A truer statment was never said.  ""But I do think that the Japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines.""  All in all in my experience out of the 5 in a row Japanese vehicles I owned. 1 I had for 2 years, 1 I had for 12 years, and the other 3 were always going back to the dealer for something or another. I'm glad I got rid of them in 3 years. Actually I'll be glad to get rid of the Bimmer. Can't enjoy it lately. Too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes.

I'll agree here. 3-series is loose without SP. I find a much bigger difference with SP on 3-series than on 5-series.

302,riez,February 2004,"Story is titled ""Hobson's Choice: Value versus charisma? Go figure.""  Overall rating was $40,628 330Ci= 97 and $33,180 CL Type-S= 96; however, the sum of the 12 individual pointed categories favored the 330Ci by 4 points (styling advantage to 330Ci by 3 points). CL-S won 4: engine, transmission, ergonomics, and value. They tied in 3: handling, ride, fit/finish. 330Ci won 5: brakes, driver comfort, features/amenities, styling, and fun to drive.  Keep in mind this CL Type-S had a 6-speed manual (vs the BMW's 5-speeds) and LSD (not available on non-M 3s). As they put it, the LSD ""produces an amazing transformation that conceals any suggestion that it is a front-driver.""  0-60 mph: 330Ci (5.8 secs), CL-S (5.9) 0-100 mph: CL-S (15.2 secs), 330Ci (15.5) 1/4 mile: 330Ci (14.4s/97mph), CL-S (14.6/98) 5-60 mph: CL-S (6.2), 330CI (6.5) Top Speed: CL-S (149 mph), 330Ci (135) Top gear, 30-50 mph: 330Ci (7.8 secs), CL-S (10.2) Top gear, 50-70 mph: 330Ci (7.8 secs), CL-S (10.2) 70-0: 330Ci (167 ft), CL-S (178) Skidpad: CL-S (.86g), 330Ci (.85g) Lane change: 330Ci (63.9 mph), CL-S (60.5) Obs. fuel economy: 330Ci (25 mpg), CL-S (22)  But guess which car is still with us (330Ci) and guess which car is no longer sold in USA (CL).

306,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"Z4 is a flat out bomb. Bangle will be BMW's undoing if he's allowed to continue to contribute his ""design philosophy.""  As for 3 sales off 25%...ouch! My guess is BMW needs to sweeten the pie and do something about prices. 35-37k for a 325i is silly when one can buy a G35 with the same equipment and more performance for 32k. BMW needs to wake up and do something about the value proposition. They don't have one!"
307,riez,February 2004,"mariner7... You have to keep in mind the impact of SUVs. Just look at Lexus. They sold a bit over 250,000 cars last year. About 52% were SUVs. Their sales of cars plummetted, esp. cars like SC430 and IS300. The GX470 SUV had huge growth. The RX330 is the big seller (something like 92,000 units.) In less than 5 years Lexus' SUVs went from about 0% to over 50% of sales!  Huge reason BMW is pushing X3 and X5. BMW reportedly seriously looking into some minivan-like SUV (which they give a fancy sounding use designation)."
308,chrisboth,February 2004,riez good points but that's just toyota with bad cars in thier lineup. SUV popularity is falling and cars are in again with overall industry trends moving away from SUV's. That may be short lived if the RX hybrid and others take the world by storm like minivans did in the 80's.  I can't think of a single reason not to buy a suv that gets 35mpg and is faster than a gasoline only counterpart...for the same money

312,riez,February 2004,"TL is brand new so hard to see trends. G35 just added the AWD version. That should boost sales in winter.  BMW, MB, VW, and Porsche are living proof that SUVs are in their futures. Just check out Porsche sales, cars and SUVs!!! Notice how many SUVs coming out or have come out from these marques? Heck, even Porsche is bringing out a V6 Cayenne priced in the low $40,000s and they expect it to account for 1/3 of Cayenne sales. Marques like Jaguar and Audi hurting for lack of product in this area. Saab is even going to the Subaru-part of GM to get their new 9-2 and 9-7.

318,mariner7,February 2004,"If you add up X5 & X3 sales, they stayed about flat. So SUV sales didn't take away from 3 sales.  The fact is TL just had the best sales month in history in Jan, and this is the 3rd gen TL. For a time it was the best selling entry luxury car, and the new one got the record right out of the gate. I'd call that a trend and an exceptionally good start.  G35, in two years, it only went from nothing to rivalling 3 as the best selling rwd car on the market."
319,riez,February 2004,"mariner7... My only points are (1) SUVs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like BMW and Lexus, (2) there can be intra-marque sales competition (e.g., the X3 and 3 Series take sales from each other as do the RX330 and ES330), (3) there is inter-marque competiton (potential buyers who didn't like the new 7 Series might go for the S Class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a G35), and (4) you have to take into account general economic and social trends (e.g., in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedans and station wagons into SUVs and light trucks).  All four factors must be evaluated when comparing a particular marque's sales over time as well as a specific model within that marque over time."
320,chrisboth,February 2004,The Audi is probably cross shopped by 3cic buyers as they are really prob more lux conscience than performance conscience. A super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. If you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well I'd think.  What are a-4 cabrio sales?
321,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"The A4 Cab is a beautiful car, and it is more of a cruiser, I think if I wanted something more sporty from Audi, I'd look for something called the TT  You'd end up with a 2 seat car. Again that's not competition for the 330cic and for the dough it's not nearly as nice of a car.  A super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so  The compromise is slight if the engineering is solid. We're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference. 10-20 years ago this wasn't true. Today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles - Z8, Viper, etc.  there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. If you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well I'd think.  Have you seen the times on that bloated cow? It's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.  Nobody is seriously challenging BMW's dominance of 4 place entry lux RWD convertibles. We know buyers are grabbing up G35 coupes and sedans. So a convertible is the next sensible step in Infiniti's quest to steal BMW's thunder.  Weird, I'm the BMW owner here and you guys seem to think it's a bad idea for Infiniti to offer a RWD convertible 4 place sports coupe."

If I did live in FLA again or CA for sure I would get a jeep cj-7 and throw the doors away...thats a convertible to me anyway.  I guess if infniti can sell some convertibles they should do it but thier lineup is being revamped and the rescources may not be there with all the new products they developed. As long as they look good and they dont flex like a lebaron ragtop I'm for it..just not in my driveway."
328,blueguydotcom,February 2004,That could be it. I've grown up with convertibles and when I bought my daily commuter I seriously considered snatching up a 99 Miata as I could get it cheap and mod it to my heart's content. I ended up going safe with my choice but as soon as February rolls around I begin to pine for the sun.  For the next few years I have to settle for dropping the windows and opening the moonroof. Or borrowing my families convertibles.
329,jrock65,February 2004,"BMW sold almost the exact same number of 3 series coupes as its 3 series convertibles in the cold month of January, so I would say that there definitely is a viable market for the G35 convertible.  I for one wouldn't mind seeing a G35 convertible."
330,speedracer3,February 2004,"It's not porky, it just has AWD. The AWD system does add weight and causes driveline loss. Regardless, the S4 compares well to the M3 (not going to slit hairs over fractions of seconds), even better you can get the S4 in a sedan which gives you all the convenience of 4 doors with the power of a sports car. I would get an S4 sedan over a M3 in a heartbeat. Better yet, give an RS4 which would chew a M3 and spit it out."
331,riez,February 2004,"Noticed in the latest issue of Autoweek (2/16/04) there is a small news ""Flash"" article titled ""Drop-top Camry"". Solara convertible that comes out in March. ""Designed from the ground up as a convertible"". FWD 225hp 3.3L V6 with 5-speed automatic.  Toyota must see some value in 2-door convertible market. Too bad no manual transmission. Maybe there will be an IS300 convertible???"

Rather small niche market to begin with let alone to try and recover development costs. Will be interesting to see if the Solara convertible sells well. If it does, maybe Lexus will create the IS300 convertible.  Lexus hasn't had too much luck selling convertibles/roadsters. Neither has Infiniti (anyone remember the M30 convertible?). Don't think Acura has even tried.  The majority of sales will still be sedans in this segment."
334,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"The majority of sales will still be sedans in this segment.  True but BMW's got so much of the market expressly because they're not only selling sedans. They've got a diverse 3 series line up and thw 1 is going to be the same way.  In fact I read recently that they plan to have a 200 HP + version of the 1. If it's convertible and under 40k, I have good feeling that will replace my little too thick 3 series.  BTW, someone said they'd take an S4 or some such variant. to each his own.

But, you're right, if you want a ""luxo"" car with vinyl seats and less than 200 hp, you can find a convertible BMW with a sticker a hair under $40K.  As tested I've seen mostly mid 5s from the S4. Even 5 seconds flat is rather unspectacular given the torque of a V8 and the power output. Typical VW, porky.  In their comparison test, C&D could get the M3 to 60 mph only 2-tenths of a second quicker than the S4. Personally, I'd make that sacrifice to save $1500, get 2 more doors, and add AWD.  oh, and C&D also had this to say ""You must work the six-speed to stay ahead, however, as shown by the top-gear 30-to-50 and 50-to-70 bursts, where the larger-displacement Audi had a significant advantage.""  and ""Of this trio, the S4 is in a class by itself, scoring the full 10 points in our handling rating, two above the M3 and three above the C32.""  not bad for the ""porky"" car."

340,speedracer3,February 2004,"Blue,  Nobody said VW doesn't have quality issues. They do, but I don't think their product is as bad as you are making it out to be. VW has an older product line and they are not discounting their cars, and that is why they are being taken to the cleaners by the American and Japanese manufacturers. I was very familiar with VW/Audi products way before I owned one (I hang out at VWvortex a lot). I chose Audi because they are better made and more reliable than their VW counterparts. So far I've had a terrific ownership experience with my A4. Sorry to hear that you had a bad experience."

I'm not convinced Infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet - they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years ago...those weren't young people in those Q's and I's that I saw over the last decade..maybe g20 and then most young people went right to the sentra and saved 15k!"

Two of their complaints I can't get my head around: idrive and lack of nav. iDrive is a snap to use in the 745i (yes I've driven them and used it without a problem) and the new version in the 5 is even more simplistic. Push a direction for a control...oops, wrong way, it's down for X control. Now you know, problem solved.  As for the navi thing...whatever. It's a fairly useless toy.

350,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"Chris, I admit the 5.1 intrigues me on the TL. But then again, I loathe the stereo in my BMW. Which isn't half bad when compared to the tinny garbage in my Protege."
351,chrisboth,February 2004,It sounds good as long as its a 5.1 cd in the player - but other than the 1 they give you at the dealer - you'd be listening to regular cd's which when played put the stereo on par with the G bose system - not bad but not exactly better by any margin than what everyone else offers for 200-240 watts.  For those of you with the upgraded bose in a G the tweeters suck and when replaced with polk ex's for $50 and half hour the sound system becomes alive and the imaging is much better. The effectively drops the crossover from 8k to 4k and makes for much better highs with that thumping bass (in the sedan anyway).  PS  I should have bought Best Buy stock on the ipo - those electronic gadgets get a huge markup and just the few that have to be first to get something new support the lower prices later on for me. This desire transcends into car options and premiums paid for them. What would people pay for the TL no blutooth or 5.1? LESS since they wont have bragging rights!  Tek nuts hate me - I still have windows 98 and a glass tube tv!
352,jrock65,February 2004,"It is no wonder that the ES330 sells so well, even though not many people seem to be enthralled with its exterior styling. With the impending death of the I35 and the new TL's emphasis on sport, it is basically the ONLY import choice that emphasizes ride quality over handling in this price category. And the general population (which is statistically not well represented by the regulars here, or the car magazines) seems to prioritize ride quality over handling. The ES330's gorgeous interior doesn't hurt it either."

When CR placed the TL over the ES in the Feb issue, they totally missed the mark as these two cars offer different ""user"" experiences. Not that people won't cross-compare or seriously won't cross-shop them, but - I can't imagine any person getting into an ES330 and thinking they are getting a sports sedan like ride. Nor can I imagine anyone getting into a TL thinking they are going to have a boat-like isolated ride.  The TL is not better than the ES, it is different. Both are high ranked above their common name baseline counterparts, but the ES doesn't even offer a sporty like ride."

If you are a German car fan and like the minimal Porsche interior, you know there's only one answer. Once you start rowing gears in a Porsche or any other sports car for that matter, you'll forget that sport sedans ever existed except for utility. In a sports car, things such as the interior, radio, squeaks and rattles have almost no significance. Of course, that is if the drive is what stirs your blood. Danny makes a good point about Ferraris etc. You will know the real sports-car enthusiast, that is DRIVER, by his odometer."
361,raher,February 2004,"I have been staying out of here for awhile but have been reading most everything. One of my observations is that there are very few women participating. The posts about women could take on on another aspect...do your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the TL and others? Most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented. Women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies. I recently read a report that said they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent. I bought our new TL for my wife. It is the third car I have purchased for her. She never test drives them or participates in the selection. All three have been Acura's. A '91 Legend, a 2000 TL and now an '04 TL. I always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury. I am the sport, she is the luxury. She loves the new TL, including the 270 HP. She isn't out racing but is in the car all day driving ( sales job ). The power comes on gradually and is very predictable. She loves the ""near luxury"" especially the seats and the stereo. The NAV is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unfamiliar places. The real thing is she looks very nice in that silver/ebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives. On the weekends I get to use the sport piece of the equation. The new TL is a perfect blend for the two of us. After 36 years of marriage I have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are. I laughed when I read the thread about ""old people"" ( anyone over 30 evidently )not pushing their cars but buying cushy luxury cars. Not always so. I am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so. I started road racing motorcycles at 38. My brother is 60 and has a V8 powered Triumph TR7. Next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a BMW/TL/??? he may just be like me and decide to have a go. Paul Newman raced well into his 60's. Bottom line...the new sport/luxury cars are a reflection of what people want to buy and in most instances the people who can afford them are older than 30 !"

364,bxd20,February 2004,"Hmmm, not sure if I agree with you that a sports sedan is an intermediate step to a ""sports car"" (whatever that means is pretty grey).  I think true car guys buy the most performance they can afford, regardless of packaging. If you have a lot of money to blow, then you probably are considering a Porsche 911. But let's say your budget doesn't allow that and you're looking to spend $50k. At that price point, I would be looking at cars such as used M5s, new M3s, a Z06, a CTS-V. I wouldn't ""demerit"" the sedans just because they're sedans. I'd look at overall performance and upon doing so I'd see that the M5 and CTS-V BELONG in the company of ""sports cars"". If I compare those two sedans against what that money buys me at a Porsche dealer (a Boxster), I would actually be taking a step down on the performance scale. Why? So I could have a car with a ""sports car"" badge on it?  Brian"

I prefer the more austere feel and appearance of Teutonic machines and even some Infinitis over anything offered by Lexus, Acura and naturally the USA.  As for the sound thing, I'm baffled as to why people think it's out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside.  Currently I drive a 2003 330i with the Performance Package. The muffler makes a constant, droning rasp that reminds me of my sister's first Miata on long drives to So Cal with the top down. The other bimmers I've ridden in are quieter but still there's too much road and wind and engine noise.  It's not too hard to figure out what I prefer given what I bought. The G35 came in 3rd in my choices as I didn't dig the sloppy suspension or typical truck-like Nissan manual. Acura's TL with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as I would have even taken a TSX 6 speed over the G35.  Nothing else was even close as, the Lexus IS bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive IS300s around here - the rich kids Jetta\?Accord). Audi's A4 lacks any sort of punch and it has fwd or its god-awful power-sapping quattro (plus I was dropping a VW as they make horrible cars). MB's C class is a joke in terms of handling and power.

I think that's how you are confusing everyone.  Unless you can feel, hear, and be totally in tune with the machine, you are falling short of true sport driving."
378,victord1,February 2004,"And that's why I didn't get the 330i. I test drove one a year ago. Loved the performance part, and but hated how loudly , IMO, the exhaust sounded with just a light touch of the gas pedal. And that car didn't even have a sport package.  I like a 'sleeper' type of car that can trounce the pavement and hug curves when called upon."
379,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"the ""revs racing"" and you have no idea when to shift unless you are staring at the tach rather than watching those curves.  I shift by feel not by engine sound. I know what my cars are doing by the pull of the engine. As I owned a car for years without a tach, I almost never look at my current ones. Shrug. Same can be said of the speedo...I'm pretty much just always scanning for the fascists in black and whites.  Still stand by my desire...absolute silence unless I decide to add some auditory stimulation."
380,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"blueguydotcom... The primary point of the quote is to show that most sources who have actually tested an IS300--including those not disposed to love it--have raved about its steering. Your counter assessment flies against the majority opinion.  Majority opinion...golly I need to change my opinion to go along with everyone else. For the last time, unless they're buying the car for me why the hell should I care what their opinion is? I have to live with it and in my experience the IS300 has numb steering."
381,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"So far you've said nothing to justify the $7,100 difference between the 325i and 330. The difference is 40 horses.  40? My car has 235 HP...regardless.  It's the same car, same tranny, same poor BMW reliability.  Actually I have a short-shift 6 speed. Again not the same. Oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential. Different chip programming. Lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams. Oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which I hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (I believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.  In addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i ZHP, I also got a few luxury features I've grown to love...memory seats, tilt mirror. Useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed I have to adjust everything back.  And unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential.  I don't know where you live but in So Cal we have annoying freeway lights. 100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.  Am I a stop light racer? No. Do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings. Redline shifts are common for me on every drive. I bought a performance sedan and I make it perform. I often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises I can punch it and take off. This cannot be done with a 325i. Ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.  The 325i has enough power to move that car very well. I personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why I went with an A4...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence.  To each his own. The A4 doesn't offer the handling (especially a FWD one) or power I want when spending over 30k for a car. There's no reason I should EVER have to worry about merging or will I have enough power to shoot a gap if I'm in a near luxury sport sedan. With the A4 (I had a 1.8T) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority I'd expect paying over 30k. Go Quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy. Add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.  We all have priorities. Mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price I found reasonable. As the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio. I'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer. The 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old Jetta. I couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch."
382,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"As for what's a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one's intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn't an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point A to point B and nothing more.  Exactly. We don't need the 200 HP engines and tight suspensions. We want them. Our cars regardless of marketing hype are totally luxury items."
383,shipo,February 2004,"What you posted was:  So far you've said nothing to justify the $7,100 difference between the 325i and 330. The difference is 40 horses.  Which means that my response was accurate, if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i, you need to add:  Sport Package: $1,400 Harman-Kardon Audio System: $675 On-Board Comuter: $300 Front Dual Power Seats: $995 Total: $2,470  That makes the price difference (still not quite apples to apples) only $4,630. That still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes, smaller engine, and a 5-Speed transmission instead of the 6-Speed on the 330i.  Is $4,630 too much for all of that? For me, it's worth it, for someone else it's not. Is it a rip-off? I don't think so.  Regarding the reliability, like virtually every manufacturer in the world, the reliability has improved dramatically in recent years, and statistically speaking, the E39 and E46 cars have improved to such an extent that they are among the best. How will the E60 fare when the bugs are worked out? Unknown.  Best Regards, Shipo"
384,speedracer3,February 2004,"So what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another $4000 added to the price to the car. Without this package the cars are essentially the same, and the same options can be added to either. Listen, it is your money, to me it makes no sense. Let's agree to disagree. I think the 330 in base form is a bigger ripoff than the 325i. BTW...I don't have Quattro or Tiptronic. Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT. The car pulls with tremendous authority and the CVT is a awesome tranny. Previous to my A4, I had a 2K Nissan Maxima (I like a car with power) and I am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8T engine. BTW...I live in S. Florida."
385,riez,February 2004,blueguydotcom... Guess I'll just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related? Why would I or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?  There can be differences in two cars. Often one test drive isn't enough. Some specific single cars are lemons. Others just aren't up to the rest. Deviations from the mean.
386,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"So what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another $4000 added to the price to the car.  No it didn't. That's a typical misrepresentation of the facts. BMW owners do it too. Get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels. At this point you're now talking about a 2k difference for an engine that's modified, modded tranny, different suspension, different interior/exterior treatment. Heck Acura and G35 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their cars!  Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT. The car pulls with tremendous authority and the CVT is a awesome tranny. Previous to my A4, I had a 2K Nissan Maxima (I like a car with power) and I am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8T engine. BTW...I live in S. Florida.  I'm glad you like it. I couldn't live with a CVT or the 1.8T engine again. They're gorgeous cars with excellent interiors and the 1.8T pulls nicely. But I love the neck-snapping ability mixed with the docile nature I can get. With a shift to 3rd I can go from 60 to 95 in a blink and transform my comfy little cruiser into a brutish thug. That's part of why I love my Jekyll and Hyde car.  If only BMW let us get that 3.2 in our 330i's...sigh...M3 sedan, yummy."
387,blueguydotcom,February 2004,"blueguydotcom... Guess I'll just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related?  When it comes to what I prefer with my money I don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me. I never said the rest of the world should bow down to the BMW or Acura or any car. I expressed my opinion on what was worth my money.  Why would I or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?  I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything. I judge for myself and make my decision from there. Experience for yourself and build your opinions from that. Repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else. You can tell me X car is horrible but I must experience it for myself.  Good example, I'm a huge movie buff. I've had netflix for near 4 years. I see movies constantly (watch zero TV) and because of my love for film I'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc. With some friends one night we saw an ad for Swept Away on pay-per-view. The common consensus among critics it was horrible. Someone snorted, ""who would see that?!"" I said I had on DVD and it was quite bad. Another friend added, ""Leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad."" It wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, I had to experience it firsthand.  There can be differences in two cars. Often one test drive isn't enough. Some specific single cars are lemons. Others just aren't up to the rest. Deviations from the mean.  That's why I've driven two of them. You can keep trying but in my experience with the IS300, the car felt numb and disconnected. The engine didn't offer the power I prefer. Like it or not, these are my opinions and I will not deviate from tham."
388,riez,February 2004,"blueguydotcom... Having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, I have some appreciation for BMW steering systems. I've also test driven 318ti, E39 525i, E46 325xi, Z3, X5, E65 745i, etc. (Have you ever done the Susan B. Kosman Drive for the Cure? It is a blast.) I didn't mind fact E39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the E39 525i/530i. Both work quite well. But I also own two IS300s, an automatic and a manual. The steering in the IS is every bit as good as that in the E39 or E46 BMWs. It is not numb. Nor disconnected. And if it is, then I guess so, too, must be the BMWs?  This is opinion based on actual comparative ownership. Not just a short test drive or two. (I also loved the steering in my former Infiniti G20t and my former Lincoln LS8 Sport.)  I find your following comment fascinating:  ""I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything.""  Aren't you writing? And essentially providing a review of something? Guess we shouldn't believe a word? I'm a strong proponent of the value of good automotive journalism and subscribe to nearly two dozen automotive publications."
389,pat,February 2004,"I think the point is that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion. There is a disagreement here about which it is pointless to continue to argue. Obviously, both of you hold your own opposing opinions and neither have any interest in being persuaded to think otherwise. And that's fine - you each feel you've made the right decisions, and that is as it should be.  But rather than expand this disagreement into more of the same with a slightly different background, let's just move on.  Thanks."
390,blueguydotcom,February 2004,I'll roll with that.
391,jrock65,March 2004,"1. The interior is a complete do over. Expect to see seat controls changed, higher quality leathers and an upgraded dash, possibly LCD instruments since that is what is coming in the new M35/M45. I also expect we will see aluminum pedals added and the titaninum painted center (or any painted trim) to disappear. This makeover of the interior is a 100% redo.  2. The sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits, or something very similar to them, on both the coupe and sedan models. For those of you with 03 model sedans that have been wanting to buy an aero kit Infiniti has just reduced the price 23%. They are closing them out because next year they will be standard.  3. Don't look for a horsepower increase because there won't be one BUT you can certainly look for a price increase."
392,merc1,March 2004,WHEN?????? Very important.  M
393,cheerioboy26,March 2004,The rumor is the updated G will be at the NY Auto Show next month along with the new M35/45....the G available in the fall.
394,prattster,March 2004,"It's good to hear the upgrades, however Nissan/Infiniti should learn from this and apply to all future new products that cutting corners to save a penny here will cut sales and hurt image possibly. Do it right from the onset and reap the rewards. As in the new Acura TL."
395,chrisboth,March 2004,"Perhaps Acura should learn from infiniti and make a sports sedan that is based on a sports car rather than front drive family car. They all look to and learn from each other.  Perhaps they did us a service those infiniti guys and instead of spending more money on the G concept and making it pricier, they figured out that what matters is not the interior its perfect balance and a rigid RWD platform. Get that right first and then improve the fluff stuff."
396,chrisboth,March 2004,Also didn't notice infiniti suffering from any reputation probs
397,danny1878,March 2004,"FYI ACURA TL sedan sales for Jan 2004 5036 units ES330 5254 units feb 2004 6274 units ES330 .... units Acura TL sales up by 1238 units compared to jan sales and over lexus in jan:)  G35 sedan sales for Jan 2004 3382 units feb 2004 3439 units only up 57 units  Feb2004 for G35 coupe is 2145 units. TL sedan sales is more than G35 sedan and coupe combines lol, good REPUTATION heh?  Lucky Acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports. 47% up in jan, 57% in feb,..."
398,cheerioboy26,March 2004,"That's right, after two years on the market, the G35 sedan is still selling at the same rate it was from the beginning. It's also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general. Winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.  G35 sedan sales up 42% from Feb 2003 sales of 2,410. That comparison is more meaningful.  I'm sure the TL did much better this month when compared to its sales in Feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.  After two years in the market, with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year, plus ongoing criticisms of the interior (some valid, some not), whether or not the styling will remain ""fresh"", the G continues to sell."
399,cheerioboy26,March 2004,"agreed. They should do that from day one. Perhaps now that they have money, they will. These cars that get this criticism most (G35, Altima) were designed at the bottom of Nissan's problems right when Ghosn came aboard."
400,speedracer3,March 2004,"Chris  Yeah, S. Florida drivers are truly a rare breed. I am surprised how some of these people get their driver's licenses.  Blue,  Talk about attention. When I had my Maxima SE everybody wanted to race me at every other stop light. That's the wrong attention. Although every once in a while I'd open it up to show that the VQ is no slouch (what a great engine). I am pretty much left alone with my A4, because they are also becoming very common around here."
401,blueguydotcom,March 2004,I loved the old 3.0 VQ. I'm not real moved by the 3.5 but it's still a solid engine.
402,buddhabman,March 2004,"Coming in to LA on the 101 is like riding on the BMW expressway. Everyday I see a dozens of 5's and 7 series and probably 50 3-series of all styles & generations. The last three days I have seen 3 or 4 7's in a row in one lane. It's amazing where all this money is coming from. The next hot car is the G35, I see a dozen of those cars each way. I am starting to see a few more of the new TL's. I have noticed 2 or 3 new ones traveling in every morning. One thing is very interesting, I noticed that the G35 drivers are fairly courteous, never competitive. When I ride in the Aero Wagon and an Audi or BMW pull up, sometimes I get competitive power on. I always nod to the M3's and M5's, but it's the new 7 series drivers that always show out."
403,fedlawman,March 2004,"My cousin just bought a Nissan Titan full-size pickup...nice truck! The interior is fresh and modern, without being too contrived (unlike the G35 and Maxima). the plastics and switchgear are kinda cheap, but oh well...  I must admit I've never seen the FX or Murano interior in person so I can't comment on their quality, but I was referring to the common styling theme that Nissan is following right now. Overall, it's not where I would want to spend much time.  I like BMW's so much (pre-Bangle) because their design/styling is purposeful. They look and feel the way they do because it's the most efficient way for the car to go about it's business...no unecessary scoops, curves, grooves, etc.  As for my TSX...I'm loving it. Now that it's got some miles on the clock, the engine has really opened up and it breathes like a sprinter. I swear if it didn't have a fuel cut-off at 7500, it would zing up to 10,000 without a problem! The cold temperatures also make a big difference with that big I-4! I love downshifting to 3rd behind slow-moving traffic, and sling-shotting out and around. This car has some serious midrange grunt...no need for 4 cyl apologies here.  I'm taking my TSX to another BMW CCA track event later this month. Hopefully, I can grind down those all-season Michelins enough to justify some new shoes (Yoko's?) before the summer.  It took a little getting used to the drive-by-wire throttle, but I've finally got heel-and-toe down in the TSX, and it is so sweet! And yes, it does have that gorgeous interior and slick 6-speed that I never grow tired of. I sometimes regret not biting the bullet and getting the BMW, not so much for it's driving experience, since the TSX satisfies very nicely. It's just that I originally wanted something different (non-Japanese), and my smarter side ruled against it. You know, what I really want is a cherry, 1989 325is to play with (sport suspension, BBS rims...oohhh). It really is the best sport sedan BMW ever made (or at least, my favorite) and I'd buy one tomorrow if it crossed my path!  Like you, my sport sedan only comes out on weekends, so it is much more fun to drive because every drive ""feels like the first time.""  I must tell you though, we got a new Volvo V70 for munchkins in January and I really enjoy driving it! Smooth ride, Barkalounger seats, and it just looks cool!  Regards,  Brian"
404,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"Isn't it funny how absence really does make the heart grow fonder? I slip behind the wheel of my car on Friday nights and it feels like a darn solid race car after 5 days of driving my rickety, loud, tinny little Protege.  As a friend pointed out one day, I even refer to the BMW as ""my car"" and the other car (the one I own) I call the commuter or by its name. It's the redheaded stepchild in my automotive family.  BTW, I'm not an SUV guy but golly that Armada's insane. I sat in one at a dealer and I felt like I was in a leather-lined bus."
405,kdshapiro,March 2004,"""BTW, I'm not an SUV guy but golly that Armada's insane. I sat in one at a dealer and I felt like I was in a leather-lined bus.""  I felt the same way when I checkout out the Lincoln Blackwood edition. Talk about $56K worth of stigma. Speaking of stigma I don't understand why we let ourselves be influenced by the sometimes ridiculous opinions of others. That's all that ""stigma"" is. A negative overreaction to the negative opinions of others."
406,blueguydotcom,March 2004,True. Regardless we all let society shape our views/behavior in some fashion.
407,victord1,March 2004,"I believe I posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back, about six months ago, about my personal experience with both cars. My sister and I own both the '03 Max SE and '03 TL-S. The TL-S has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high RPM, and possibly exterior look. I like the Max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both cars have slush box), and bigger size.  To most people, both cars are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the Max.  Now I haven't test-driven the '04 TL yet, but I assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. I tested the '04 Max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the '03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car's bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the '03. And don't even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!  When the new '06 BMW 3series come out in late '05, I'll probably trade in the Max for the ""older"" version '05 3's. Personally I think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in titanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, I've grown tired of the bigger Max. Now if I can only get pass the BMW reliability issues......oh well, then there's always a TL :-)"
408,mariner7,March 2004,"I agree the G35 is hot. I see more and more of them around the wealthy suburbs of DC. I bet in the past a large % of those would be 3's. I'm sure new TL will show up, after all old ones were all over the place.  Surprisingly, the hot SUV, to my eyes, is the Murano. It's starting to compete with RX, MDX and Volvo in burbs. Well, not too surprising, it got more style than any of the others."
409,qbrozen,March 2004,"thanks for the rundown on the Maxis. Good to know I'm not nuts for hating this thing.  I strongly suggest checking out the '04 TL. I did try the previous gen TLs and, while I liked it, I found it rather boring. The new one is a HUGE improvement."
410,speedracer3,March 2004,"The one thing I do not like about about the TSX/TL is that they have not shaken their Honda family resemblance. The TSX is an Euro Accord, and the TL ( I see the old Civic tailights on this car) is just a larger version of it. What I liked about the G35 is that no current Nissan car looks remotely like it. I applaud Honda for giving Acura a more aggressive ""look"", (the old TL was just blah to look at) but I look at a TSX/TL and still see just another Accord on the road."
411,designman,March 2004,"The Maxima looks like a twin brother that is a little too addicted to sausage pizzas. I find the G35 look tolerable, but it's not exactly svelte either.  Sedans are bloated across all automotive brands... grotesque features... no attention to fine details. Rubenesque is in.  My advice to auto designers... have a salad."
412,speedracer3,March 2004,"Don't get me started about the new Maxima. I despise its looks. Now, the G35 coupe is sex on wheels."
413,designman,March 2004,"Hey, whatever turns you on. I always thought fashion models could stand to eat a Sicilian slice or two.  ;-)"
414,glenford,March 2004,"Drove a 330 and a 325 this week. Both awd (bad driveway, NY winters). Liked them both - great feeling car (for the limited time I got to do it). While I might not have thought this if I drove just the 325, after driving the 330 the 325 power seemed nice, but not great. Of course, in most cases, not a real issue.  I'm off (in the near future) to drive a G35x. On paper, looks like I can have 330 power for less than 325 price, at a higher level of equipment (cd changer, leather, and still less than the 325). Recent years' reliability looks comparable.  Nothing else looks close to these two to me (Audi has some reliability issues, I think. No Volvo dealer nearby, and not so sporting,...)  AWD is a must have.  Thoughts? Tim"
415,designman,March 2004,"Indeed, G35 coupe has a nice shape and aft section. Front is a little bulbous. But I'll buy the sexy description.  I also think Evo and IS Sport Cross are sexy.  But to me the real lookers are the sports cars... 911 Coupe and Targa, Boxster, Miata, S2000, 350Z Coupe and Roadster. I think the new Vette is an improvement but it can't seem to shed that big truncated butt. Z4 should be used as prop for C-grade monster movies such as The Blob."
416,mariner7,March 2004,"G35 & Max share some family resemblance but total effect is quite different. G35 sedan looks light, where Max is just too heavy handed.  When previous TL came out as a concept, I was very impressed by its look. A relative of mine was looking for a car. I recommended the car to him, he bought the car before it came out as production. By the end of its cycle, I couldn't stand the sight of that car, to me the design aged really badly."
417,victord1,March 2004,"The new '04 Maxima is never in my plan to replace my current Max....honestly, I like mine better. To me it seems that while Acura has moved the new TL closer to the BMW 3series, Nissan did just the opposite with the new Max.  For someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the Max is an excellent choice. However, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties, a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable.  When it's time for my trade-up, the only cars I have in mind are the new TL , the G35/G35X, possibly the up-coming 250Hp AWD Subaru (for the AWD factor), and the 3series as the most favorite. I like almost everything about the car, except reliability.....sorry, didn't mean to sound like a broken record :-)"
418,designman,March 2004,"What I like about the G35 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance IMO. It has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. Also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. I think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. Headlights say Maxima, grille says Cadillac.  TL has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. Accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. And that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. I'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. The wedge works better with smaller cars like TSX and RSX. By the way, on the Acura website, they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting… notice how dark the bumper is in all shots. But when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large. I&#146;m sure the TL is going to be a winner, but I think it would have been dead-nuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit. The wedge may say sport, but it does not say elegance… larger sedans have to keep it to a minimum.  Not totally happy, but I&#146;ll take either one of these cars on looks… for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines… no unnecessary topography. They sure do beat the Bangle bimmers."
419,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"I like the TL's shape. I prefer creases and hard lines and edges. I do not like large flat surfaces - like the slab sides of the G35, the CTS and the just plain ugly doors on the G35 coupe.  The new bangle designs also feature too many flat surfaces. Bangle seems to model everything after mushy ice cream that was refrozen. Weird angles, nothing solid and exceptionally bland."
420,danny1878,March 2004,"Sorry,I have to add  Reliability, resale value, performance, features, gas consumption, luxury to me is considered as in quality.  I tried to make assumptions what if G35 or ES330 or 330i was the one on the top sales chart. I wonder what is the dominant factor? I was confused myself. :-). Do you have the answer?  Intensive marketing/advertising programs, patriotism (doesnt apply to these cars except GM, ford), fanaticism, better incentives, popularity, different market segment. I dont see any of those apply to these cars. What do you think Iwantonetoo? What is it that makes people buy the car? luck is not a smart answer."
421,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"You've completely missed my point sales indicate only that X number felt Product A was worth their dollars. That's it. 5k people dug the TL last week. It doesn't mean it's a good car, bad car or reflect anything about the car, only that 5k people dug it.  About torque steer, I choose a car based on my purposes only. How many time you plant your foot to the pedal when taking a corner? TL's cornering is not the best but one of the best IMO. How many time you speed your car when driving in a highway? Many times lol How much time do you spend inside your car? How many time do you risk your car in a race track? Do you care about resale value or not? Do you care about gas consumption or not?  I can answer every question with one thing: toy. That's what my BMW is to me. It's not transportation, an investment or practical. It's a toy.  Do you care about your family or not? (are you selfish?) etc.  What does this have to do with buying a car?"
422,danny1878,March 2004,"It does to me bcuz if I dont care about them, I would buy a coupe not sedan with stiff suspension, loud engine and no sound system so I could take the car to a race track. No wife and kids at last free from the jail lol.  Fyi its not 5k people who dug TL lastweek but 6+k people.  I respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy. I think you must be very rich but not me. I am not rich and I earn my living by working hard.  The reason is because product A was worth their dollars, hmmm thats a good one. It doesnt mean good or bad, agreed.:-)"
423,jrock65,March 2004,"Well, I feel that relative sales numbers to cross-shopped items do reflect something about the product (whether it be the TL, any other car, or any other product for that matter.) I guess we'll just have to disagree and leave it at that.  In any case, I for one am glad that the TL is FWD. I definitely feel that RWD is more fun to drive and that FWD has its limits, but some people want a sporty experience in a FWD setup (for foul weather purposes), and are not willing to pay the extra $2000 or so to get AWD, and its associated decrease in gas mileage.  It just makes more economical sense for Honda to make the TL FWD, since platform sharing with the Accord and the TSX helps keep costs down. They don't make a single RWD sedan yet. Even though Honda/Acura NA sells more cars than Nissan/Infiniti NA, Nissan is a significantly bigger company in Japan than Honda."
424,blueguydotcom,March 2004,I respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy. I think you must be very rich but not me. I am not rich and I earn my living by working hard.  Sigh...all entry lux cars are toys. The class of vehicle is by definition a luxury item. We could all get by fine with a 1995 Accord. Yet we're blowing 30-35-40k on silly cars.  I'm not gonna get into some personal thing about working hard or not. Leave the personal stuff out of it.
425,riez,March 2004,"danny1878... Why are you including the Lexus ES330 in this group? There isn't anything ""performance"" about it. You should be including the IS300. IS is RWD, can be had with optional LSD, and is available with a manual transmission. ES is FWD, no LSD, and no manual transmission. And the IS is clearly at the low end of the $30-40K range--great value for the money, with outstanding reliability, great dealer service, and good crash test results."
426,kdshapiro,March 2004,"""Sigh...all entry lux cars are toys.""  Let me get this straight so I understand the conversation. The Acura TL is a toy, but the Honda V6 full-loaded for $7K less, is plebian basic run-of-the-mill appliance transportation. The TSX, which is the same price as the Honda is a toy. Okay, now I got it.  I'm not sure why it's important that one believes there is a line in the sand between basic run of the mill appliance transportation and toy, but I'm trying to understand the price at which toy becomes necessity. In my mind anything more than a Hyundia Excel is a toy. It's just a matter of degree.  Then the conversation becomes, which toy is the most expensive, fun to own, most reliable, etc. So while I agree with you blueguy, nobody *needs* a car like this. It's obvious that people *want* these types of cars."
427,victord1,March 2004,"It's individual priority. Do you want your ""toy"" to be more practical, or just insanely fun to play with???  But then again fun varies among each of us--what kind, how much, how often.......  Then there's ""just-got-to-have-it"" factor. My sister, who drives at or under the speed limit and changes lane blocks or even miles before making a turn, just has to have the TL-S. She doesn't drive on the beltways and interstates (and I mean absolutely never) and never ventures into an unfamiliar area (not without me as the driver), but she wanted that navigation system.  And I guess it's epidemic because now I just got to have a 330i :-)"
428,hoyahenry,March 2004,How much time do you spend inside your car?  At least now I can't get enough.  According to the MID the car and I were together for 10 hours on the first tank of gas. Such is life here in DC when the Avg mph is in the low 20s in 60% 'highway' driving.
429,eaton53,March 2004,"The TL A-Spec is getting dangerously close to the price to the out-the-door price of a CTS-V. One of the folks on the CTS board said he bought a V for $45K.  If that's true, forget the A-Spec... it's not even close."

431,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"My view of all new cars is that they're luxury items. We could all pick up a solid 6-7 year old Accord/Camry/Altima for very little dough and it'd serve the purpose. A 99 Civic DX would satsify most ""needs."" Room for the dog, AWD, AC, leather, etc are luxuries.  I have no delusions about my cars. They're not need based items. They don't approach food or shelter on the scale of things one must have to survive. I know very well that I can get by fine on an old Nissan sedan as I did through college and many, many years after it.  And 40k for a TL is outrageous. The A-spec package should be at most 3k over a standard TL."
432,qbrozen,March 2004,"still nothing i can find on the acura website. I'd be really surprised if its almost $10K more unless it involves engine mods, which i seriously doubt. if anyone can find proof of pricing and post the link, I'd appreciate it. But, for now, I'm not believing the pricing until I hear it right from the manufacturer."
433,riez,March 2004,"qbrozen... Just read the plethora of magazine articles that have appeared recently on the A-specs. These type mods normally cost upwards of $5,000. New tires, wheels, exterior trim pieces, etc. Not to mention suspension pieces. Lexus tried something similar a couple years ago with the IS and GS, the L-tuned. Spec I was about $3-4K and Spec II was around $5-6K. It bombed in marketplace. Tuner types would rather do it themselves, often for less or to be wilder. Nissan is trying same with Nismo for Sentra SE-R Spec V and 350Z. Not cheap. Nissan has S-tuned for street and R-tuned for racing."

436,blueguydotcom,March 2004,jrock  What are the exact upgrades of the A-spec on the TL...  What the BMW costs is not relevant either. We're talking about a 32k car with X options. Tell us what those options are.
437,jrock65,March 2004,"You decided to bring the BMW ZHP package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the A-spec package vs. the ZHP package.

It may not be relevant to you, but it is relevant to me and others.  Frankly, I agree with you, I also think the A-spec package is overpriced. I'm not really interested in it, but I'm sure that there is some site on the internet that lists what you get with the A-spec package."
438,danny1878,March 2004,"The price of A-Spec is $5,2k plus installation $700.  It is overpriced. With standard options of TL is more than enough. MSRP of TL $33,2k w/o Navi. or $35,3k with Navi."
439,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"jrock,  You decided to bring the BMW ZHP package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the A-spec package vs. the ZHP package. Basically your point is that the A-spec is overpriced.  No, I was not comparing the values of the two. I merely pointed out to riez that a major manufacturer can cheaply add many, many elements to a performance package at a price that isn't a 33% jump over the base.  My point is that if you're going to compare it in that way, i.e. compare it feature for feature, the 330i is overpriced. It may not be relevant to you, but it is relevant to me and others.  I was talking about what's added equipment wise. X base, what's added to it to get to Z total. The TL stickers for like 32-33k. Loaded. Whatever they're adding, from what i've seen it's an aero kit, some suspension/tire mods and a tweaked exhaust it's not nearly worth 10k. We're talking parts...not the value of the car. Even if the TL stickered at 25k as is and the a-spec raised the price to 35k I'd be annoyed as the parts could be added aftermarket for that price.  And value is subjective. At 25k I probably would have bought a TL. 33k? Nope. That's why they make different cars - because not everybody wants to drive one type of vehicle."
440,chrisboth,March 2004,"Do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time.  Maybe some will want the body packages and the ASPEC buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car. All the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help. The funnest thing of owning a G has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that I can notice and tweak. Do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy. I would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves. The ZHP is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet.  For 200 bucks I added 10-14 Hp with an intake. For another 120 I added no real gains with my Hyper Grounding Kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created. For another 450 I bought a Crawford Z car intake plenum which adds 20hp. So for less than 1k I got about 20-25 HP at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and I don't have the HP drop at 6000.  If they offered a $6000 nismo package I' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.  Now I belive I am running Z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#. Anyone see the Z in the lastest C&D. They got a 13.8 1/4 running stock at 102 or so. Everytime they test the FM seems faster and faster! Break in alone is good for 20hp I'd bet with the VQ."
441,shipo,March 2004,"I am of two minds on this one. In most cases, I would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself, most likely after the manufacturers' warranty expired. That said, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i ZHP, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies. So, in the case of the 3-Series, I'd be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade.  Best Regards, Shipo"
442,blueguydotcom,March 2004,Another funny thing about the 330i to ZHP switch: it's really a crazy number of mods for only $2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package ($1200).
443,jrock65,March 2004,"Well, apparently the ZHP package is popular enough that they're putting it on the coupe and convertible as well.  I'm not sure why Infiniti is nixing Nismo, especially since they're going for the Japanese BMW image (everything RWD or AWD, handling a priority, etc.)  Most boy racer kids won't be able to afford it anyway."
444,shipo,March 2004,"Okay, fair enough, I hadn't considered that the difference between the 330i SP and the 330i ZHP was considerably less than just the cost of the ZHP. As such, I went through and configured the three as I would have ordered them.  325i, 5-Speed, Metallic Paint, Leather, PP, SP, Harmon Kardon: $36,595 330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, PP, SP, Xenon: $41,570 330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, ZHP, Leather, Moon Roof, Xenon: 43,470  So, in the ""As I would buy it"" configuration, the 330i comes at a $4,975 premium. Fairly substantial, however, IMHO, the considerable power gain, coupled with the 6-Speed transmission, bigger brakes, and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price.  Then there is the 330i to 330i ZHP difference of only $1,900, a no-brainer on a car listing at over $40K.  Best Regards, Shipo"
445,speedracer3,March 2004,"Here's the quote from the April 2004 C&D  Things are getting complicated at Nismo, Nissan's motorsports and tuning arm. So, far, the U.S. distributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension, wheel, and exhaust packages for the 350Z. And ideally, the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the Infiniti G35 coupe (known as the Nissan Skyline coupe in Japan).Because, hey, this Nismo Skyline developed together with Sony's Gran Turismo people looks pretty damn good. The problem is that in the U.S. the car is an Infiniti, not a Nissan, as it is in Japan, and the U.S. marketing types feel that Nismo parts might not suit the upscale brand image."
446,riez,March 2004,"shipo... Your numbers point out the lack of value at the high end of the 3 Series. You're looking at $41,600 and $43,500 for 330i. That is just way too expensive.

I haven't driven the CTS-V yet but given the way the original CTS was a lumbering, wallowing boat I flat out do not believe any review written about it. The mags praised that trash heap when it hit the street and I gotta say handling wise it didn't hold a candle to any Japanese or German in the class. From the IS to the A4 on they all outclassed the CTS in handling.

The CTS-V appears to be a ton of car for the money.  You might not want to check out the latest CR. They pound MB, Audi, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mini, and VW for poor reliability. And they cite the A6 and 7 Series as repeat offenders. They list the 7 Series ('97-'99 and '00-'02) and X5 ('00-'02) as used cars to avoid.  The 3 Series now has average reliability. Which is an improvement(!), so they can now recommend it. Is that damning with faint praise?  But BMW can't hold a candle to Infiniti or Lexus.

There isn't a German or Japanese competitor - including the ES - that should be worried.

473,chrisboth,March 2004,Got the Valentine one but laser is still tough to see ahead of time - i think its instant on and it has to be on you to detect. the only time my V-1 went off for laser and I had time to slow down i was right behind another guy that got tagged and there was about 3 seconds to spare.  On the same trip this weekend the guy in front of me was tagged - got nailed and I never heard a blip...Laser is bad and more departments are spending the $...
474,speedracer3,March 2004,The Best: (if you don't mind paying $300+)  Valentine One  The Rest:  I have a Cobra (forgot the model)...does the job. Havent gotten a ticket since. cost around $40.
475,speedracer3,March 2004,"Yeap, with laser, you gotta hope that somebody is getting clocked before you are so your detector can pick it up...if you are ahead of the pack and can't see the trooper, you are toast."
476,pat,March 2004,"Eaton53, you ARE taking blueguydotcom's distaste for American cars too personally. As he said, it is just his opinion - he's not trying to convince you that he's right. You and he just see things differently.  Take it easy, okay?"
477,blueguydotcom,March 2004,Valentine...I'm always so tempted to spring for one as I drive 90 miles a day to and from work.  I just blew $500 bucks on new rear tires so right now I'm not real enthused about spending more for a car...

480,danny1878,March 2004,"IMO I dont care who or which country that make the car, as long as it meets my requirement then its fine.  Why people keep comparing a 5.7 litre engine with ~3.0 litre engine? $50k VS $30-40k? What about the 3.6 CTS-V which is more makes sense.  There is always something that we dont like either its about the look, reliability, performance, luxury etc. For 50k I would go with Lexus/BMW and maybe the future model of RL (need to see it first thou). Its a blunt attempt to make a car with performance only without considering other aspects."
481,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"However when you say I want an American Car company(Ford or whomever ?) to go out of business, the line between car discusion passion and financial political discussion gets crossed.  As a passionate car lover I'm speaking from a purely emotional level. I feel the same way about Steven Spielberg, Microsoft, McDonald's and a host of other franchises/companies that represent qualities I dislike.  Of course on a business school, bottom-line side I totaly understand the economic ramifications created by voiding any of these moneymakers. The ardent capitalist side screams, ""Make money any way you can. Sell them a box of rocks fro $1000 and call it Mars' Diamonds.""  The cold, business school trained analytical side tends to scare more people than the emotional side.

485,shipo,March 2004,"...regarding ""Near Luxury Performance Sedans"".  As a point of reference, I drive a 2002 530i 5-Speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the MSRP up to nearly $49,000. That said, I got a good deal and did the European Delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of $43,000. That of course does not count the cost of the European trip, but I would have taken it anyway (and rented a car while I was there).  From my point of view, my car completely meets my needs, wants and desires. It's fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it's power and ability to go fast. What do I mean by that last bit? On the autobahn during my ED trip, I was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph. I performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes. At our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).  Having said all of that, I have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money. Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""Upgraded"" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.  Balance, that's what the BMW offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get. So, if I had it to do all over again, and if I was faced with the choice of a CTS-V or my 530i for about the same price, what would I choose? Probably the BMW. Call me naïve, call me dumb, call me wasteful, call me a poseur, call me whatever you like. I can live with that. ;-)  Best Regards, Shipo"

492,qbrozen,March 2004,"shipo, I'm glad you like your car and feel safe in it, but its extra mass means that it has worse skidpad numbers and longer braking than many of the cars in the title of this discussion. So I would certainly not say that they cannot handle the situation as well or better."
493,chrisboth,March 2004,"Yeah I'd take a 28,000 G in that situation over any non M BMW. And I'd take a BMW over 99.8% of all other makes and models out there. I think the numbers and actual dynamics of both cars are good but there is a consistently better performance margin from the G which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation. And we've beat the brakes thing to death. The BMW is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux G. Doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there. Both cars on the autobahn are better than any caddy - so far...Shipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesn't make it better...I was dissapointed in what i've discovered about the CTSV and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making."
494,shipo,March 2004,"Extra mass compared to what? Not trying to pick a fight, however, the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal G35 Sedan; that's not even a tank of gas. That said, the SP on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the G35, my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference. Call it a draw.  Regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation I found myself in, you will notice that I was referring a (presumably) nose heavy CTS-V and not the G35. I consider the G a reasonably well balanced car with very acceptable driving characteristics. To my eye however, its styling inside and out just doesn't pass muster, which I understand is simply personal preference.  Best Regards, Shipo"
495,bxd20,March 2004,"CTS-V is 54/46 according to Road and Track. That's not nose heavy.  Since you are commenting quite a bit about your 5 series and weight, consider this comment by C&D Mar 2004 in regards to the M5 vs. CTS-V:  ""Cadillac's steering was gratifyingly precise. It turned in like Marshall Faulk cutting for the goal line, and if its weight transfer wasn't quite as smoothly managed as the M5's, there wasn't a hint of reluctance in its transient responses. The CTS-V was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted. The breakaway might be a little more abrupt, but once rotation set in, it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot.""  As we all know, the CTS-V edged out the M5 in lap times despite the driver admittingly short-shifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the CTS-V. In his best estimate, he would have beaten the M3 as well if pushing the Caddy at 100%.  Brian"
496,shipo,March 2004,"Hmmm, 54/46 sounds nose heavy to me, maybe not FWD nose heavy but front biased nonetheless, especially when compared to the 50.1/49.9 of the 530i.  Regarding the E39 M5 that was so gracefully retired, still at the top of the heap last year; I suppose that Cadillac should in all fairness be able to crow about being ""King of the Hill"", for a while that is. Like everything else out there, the competition does not stand still. The odds on bet is that the CTS-V will once again be considered an ""Also-Ran"" in a year's time or so, just like the CTS has been since it was launched.  Best Regards Shipo"
497,qbrozen,March 2004,"The TL is nose heavy, but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gen's sport package 530 on the skidpad (the 2004 is a big improvement, however).  I do stand corrected on the mass, however. I thought it was much heavier than it really is.  As far as the CTSV being an ""also-ran"", I think it will still be held up as ""the most bang for the buck"" regardless. Its the same reason the Z06 does so well in comparisons with much more expensive cars. Its not that its the best, but its good enough that the reviewers would opt for it and save a bundle of money over similar vehicles."

The E60, Sport Package or otherwise, comes equipped with ""Run-Flat"" tires, while mine is equipped with good old fashioned performance tires that will go flat if punctured. So, what's my point? So far anyway, everything that I have read regarding the handling and braking capabilities of the new Run-Flat tires has been less that complementary.

For 0-60 mph fans, read the fine print in each source for how they do their test. The mags use different methods. And keep in mind that some magazines adjust the times for temperature and other conditions while other publications publish the actual realized figure.

Let me setup a scenario: You go to the track to race somebody in a CTS-V, or even - say - a Pontiac GTO. After they smoke you, you get out - fuming mad - and shout: ""Well, my car has more horsepower per liter! That's all that counts. That's what makes my engine superior. They cheated! They have more displacement"".  Sound absurd to you? Well, that's what your argument amounts to. This is a miserable debate - born out of lies and advertising propaganda - that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet, by people who overpaid for imports (with engines that the dealers said is superior to anything made in America) and then end up getting owned by folks driving cars with ""old-tech"" OHV engines.  A couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that it's better to produce additional power by revving at higher RPM's than it is by increasing displacement. Why? Because they said so. Because they have English degrees (and no science training) from 3rd rate universities to back it up. That's why. And anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite.  I suppose for you old dudes, it's kind of like Vietnam. ""They lied to us man, they lied to us!!!"" =]  Now the 2004 BMW 530 isn't a bad car, but it is overpriced. And it looks like a Honda from the rear. And if you think it's any performance match for the CTS-V, then I'm afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of 'Nam.  First of all, I'd like to point out that the Euros would make more high displacement engines if they could. ""There's no replacement for displacement"". In their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement. That's why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes. When displacment is limited, and you're making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you'll get more power out of DOHC, even though OHV has a higher power density (which I will explain in a minute).  Second, displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. Repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. GM's LS6, for example, is smaller than Nissan's 3.5L VQ (a V6 engine). OHV engines have more compact packaging than DOHC's. That's why the LS6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that BMW has got.  Third, the LS6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than BMW's M5 and M3 engines. It's smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful. I fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of BMW's M engines are. And keep in mind, I'm talking about the M engines. Your 530 engine isn't even in this league.  Finally, I don't know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a CTS-V. The CTS-V smoked the BMW M5 and M3 on the Nurburgring. It's fast in 0-60, and it's no slouch in 60-0 thanks to the 14 inch Brembos.  For that matter, I doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 3.6L 255HP CTS that sells well equipped for ~$35,000."

In the 2003 Vehicle Dependability Study, Cadillac cleaned BMW's clock:  http://www.jdpa.com/presspass/pr/images/2003050bfull.gif  In the 2003 Initial Quality Study, the Cadillac CTS has 88 problems per 100 vehicles, which is better than any car made in Europe, and beaten by only a handful of Toyota products and 2 Chevrolets when compared to *all* cars sold in America.  http://www.jdpa.com/presspass/pr/images/2003028dfull.gif  The Subaru WRX is a noisy little buzzbox with a cramped interior and an uncomfortable ride. It is most definitely not any kind of luxury car. It's an econobox that's been pushed to the max. I suppose some people (like those who actually liked that movie ""Fast and Furious"") might go for such a thing, but I wouldn't want to be caught dead in one."
520,95gt,March 2004,Think you are going way overboard there. The STI has no sound deadning material and does not even come with a radio. That is far different than the G35's use of low end plastics.  And as the STI is comparable in every performance catagory to sports cars costing far more I would say yes it is a sports car. Good luck finding an is300 or 3 series that can compete with it.  Performance is an aspect of luxury but does not make a car a luxury car. All the sedans we are discussing have a blending of luxury/performance.
521,riez,March 2004,"A loaded WRX might just barely get near the target criteria, but the STi is a niche dedicated pocket rally rocket that is all performance and no amenities. A loaded Legacy GT also near.  Way I look at it is that the FWD 4-cyl TSX and 9-3 set the bare minimum for this category. From there you initially move up to the 325i, X-type 2.5, and C-class. Then onto the IS300, G35, TL, X-type 3.0, 330i, etc. Hard to say where it ends. But always thought $40,000 was into the next category.  Subaru just doesn't seem to pass the marque bar. Certain marques almost automatically qualify: Acura, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, Lincoln, MB, Saab, and Volvo. But VW is clearly moving into this market.  Thinking the Passat W8 6-speed manual and Sport Pkg certainly qualifies in our discussion. If VW can, guess Subaru might too? Old Ford Taurus SHO would have, too."
522,chavis10,March 2004,"""True, cadillac has come a long way in quality but comparing it to the M series is utter nonsense.""  Nonsense, how so? M3 is stripped of must luxurious content yet commands an extreme price hike. M5 is fast and great, but look at the price compared to say a CTS-V which has similiar size, features, power, etc. I know a new one is coming out to so yall can save that lecture. I'm just illustrating the point the more companies are going to continue to succesfully low ball BMW and MB with equally equipped and performing cars for thousands less. WRX and STi might have all the performance in the world, but they are narrow focused products. The what determines a near luxury car from say pocket rocket. WHat else can the Evo/Sti do but go fast?    ""Cramming 400 horses down its throat, just isn't going to cut it.""  That's another interesting post. People on here are talking about the Sti and Evo being near luxury cars and others are saying the CVT-S isn't going to cut it when a comparably equipped 530i or E320 with 225 and 221 hp respecively can cost more than the V. Well, if the V won't cut it, what will? You get 400hp, standard everything except sunroof, and a usuable rear seat and trunk all for under $51k. Meanwhile, 6 cyl BMW 3s and MB Cs can touch $44+ without a problem. A define near luxury cars as those who's prices start around $30k and provide somewhat uplevel features and safety equipement not found or not standard on cheaper midsized cars. There are a few cars that bend the rule such as the Maxima or Avalon. They can be had stripped or equipped with almost every two in the book. A WRX or Evo are not near luxury cars by any strech of the imagination. However, hear's the real question, how can cars like the 3 series and C class be near luxury when people can barely fit in the back seat? I would just have a problems plunking down $40k if I couldn't fit in the back or get a weekends worth of suitcases in the trunk."
523,qbrozen,March 2004,"nobody is arguing with you that performance isn't luxury. BUT, we're saying its not the ONLY criteria to be considered a luxury (or near luxury) sedan. By your standards we'd have to include the Neon SRT4 here. Or why not even an expensive motorcycle?  Is a ride in the space shuttle a luxury? Yes. But what the heck does that have to do with a luxury sedan? Hey, you can get shot out of a cannon and go REALLY fast. Is that a luxury? And, if so, does it have anything to do with this discussion? if a tree falls in the forest .... ah, forget it."
524,iwantonetoo,March 2004,"Funny you mentioned this one. I actually test drove one last night, phenomenal performance, especially so at 21k. However, at no time did the word luxury ever enter my mind. But I was still grinning an hour after my drive. This little car has some serious seeds, but it sure isn't luxurious."
525,john_ohio,March 2004,"I would agree, that if you don't have leather power seats, you are not luxury. Of course, just having them does not luxury make (my 01 Accord Coupe EX-V6 had a power leather seats, and it was not luxury).  The STi is not luxury. Fast? Yes. Cool? To me, yes, to others yes, to some, no?  Would I want one? Hell no, not at 34, with three kids.  The 04 TL 6 speed manual with navigation was the best combination of luxury and performace I could get in my price range (also looked at Maxima, ES, IS, G35).  There is obviously a class of car...hmmm...sports sedans perhaps, that combine performance and luxury. Some tilt more to performance (IS, 3/5 series), some more to luxury (ES, G35) and some are a perfect blend of the two...my TL (ducking now as those German fans throw stuff at me).  No way that the STi is a sports sedan. Great perfromance. No luxury."
526,chrisboth,March 2004,"""I'll say it again. Performance is luxury. ""  So my zx-11 ninja is the king of the land then?  Luxury is not a function of power and perf. A town car and a 3 series are both luxury. As luxury's go, I'd say speed is one of them...but alone it does not a lux car make. How is an STI that most people think is (AND IS) an impreza ever considered lux? Unless the platform is rigid as 3 series or even a passat then forget it. It's an economy car that goes fast..real fast. Lux cars have luxury and are not annoying to drive tho after a 9 hour trip"
527,designman,March 2004,"A-h-h-h you guys are no fun. :-(  Does the 911 belong in the ""High End Luxury Marque"" thread? I say yes and our host Pat agreed when the couch-potato-luxury fans tried to throw it out.  STi costs the same as TL and G35... all are available with four doors.  Pat, what do you say? Does STi get the boot?  ;-)"
528,buddhabman,March 2004,"Look at the topic - ""Near Luxury"". I am not about to argue that the STi is a luxury car but it could be a near luxury car pretty quickly if Subaru so decided. Can you say ""Saaburu 9-2X"", which is quickly thrwon together car. The STi is not that far away as some are making it out to be.  For 3-4K more: ONSTAR/NAV, more leather/suede/aluminum, sound deadining, Mcintosh stereo, the plain WRX aero wing for you ""Too Cool Stylistas"" would dress this car up nicely. So for 35-36K you could have a car that blows away all of the popular cars in this segment, and still nice enough to take out a young lawyer babe.  Never mind the STi though, the new Legacy is gonna take care of this segment soon enough."
529,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"Than a SVT. It's weird, unofficial combination of the starting price, make, content and aim of the vehicle, NOT the final price loaded.  The Imprezza is an econobox at heart, as is the Neon. The Legacy is a mid-size people mover like the Accord and Camry. They're all from manufacturers that are purely pedestrian.  Acura's often noted as a tweener company as things like the RSX on the low end keep the high end from being taken seriously.  Go into Nordstrom and you see button downs for $15 like at Mervyn's then you're dragging down the brand. And when buying near luxury, you are buying into a brand image - which is entirely perceived.  Subaru builds a fast car on a cheap platform. It's a fast, cheap car that has prices which edge toward 30k.  The same can be said of say Dodge with its 300m. It's still in the same exact brand as the 14k Neon."
530,blueguydotcom,March 2004,Who knew?!
531,danny1878,March 2004,"To me G35 is near luxury performance sedan. It has good performance, good sound system, features of luxury car.  On the other hand, STI does not even TRY to become one. Yes it has performance, but thats about it. No more and the price tag of this car is below near luxury performance sedan. Loud engine, no radio. I dunno but IMO Luxury means comfort, relaxing car environment, quiet ride, and maybe auto features for all devices such as dual auto climate, auto on off light, rain sensing wiper, auto pilot (just kidding).  CTS-V, 5 series price tag is above near luxury sedan."
532,designman,March 2004,"I'm not saying STi is luxurious in terms of butt-fluffing comforts. I'm saying its price tag qualifies it as ""near luxury"". And as a butt-kickin' ""performance sedan"", it qualifies as an appropriate subject of conversation in this thread."

The recent crossover SUV, AWD sedan platforms today owe themselves to Subaru. The Legacy/Outback started the trend. The WRX kicked it up a notch for sedans. Why do you think BMW came out with a ZHP perforamce package, out of their nature for value? Why are so many sedans in the 240-280HP range? Prior to the WRX we were stuck at 175-220HP.  OMG - Infiniti is now a luxury brand. OK ;] Who knew?  Acura, Infiniti, Lincoln, Saab, Volvo are premium brands. Audi, Jag, and Lexus are luxury brands. Infiniti is moving up but not quite there. Subaru is a premium brand in terms of engineering but not there in terms of prestige. The upgraded Legacy might change that perception.  Never mind the STi, the new Legacy is gonna take care of this segment soon enough."
534,blueguydotcom,March 2004,The Imprezza starts at under 20k. It's not a near luxury vehicle. I can drop 10k worth of extras on a Camry Solara and get its price to 30k. That car is still a Toyota and it's still based on a Camry.  Price does not equal luxury status. Nobody calls a 35k Explorer a near luxury vehicle. Or a 40k Expedition a luxury vehicle. It's still a Ford.
535,dhanley,March 2004,"If an ES300 was on sale for $10K would that make it no longer near-luxury? Would it be out-luxuried by a 15K dune buggy?  I think everyone understands that the lichpin for luxury is comfort. To me, climate control is a big must-have for any luxury car. Quiet and some degree of isolation from envronmental harshness is another.  And saab is definitely a luxury car. At a time i had a '97 328 and a '97 900SET and the SET in several ways was more luxurious (seats), although in several ways not (isolation)."
536,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"I wouldn't consider Saab, Volvo, Audi or Acura luxury brands. They're tweener brands - they can't quite get over the hump to being considered on par with Lexus or MB.  Remember Luxury is branding. A ford by nature of being a ford is not a luxury vehicle. The GT is still a Ford, regardless of price and performance.  Kmart can sell a leather coat with diamonds for 5k but it's still not an Armani."

If the TSX held the bottom rung they might get looked at as a luxury brand. With the TL they could for certain. But the RSX is little more than a rebadged Civic - much like the old G20 being a rebadged, leather-lined Sentra."
539,pat,March 2004,"""Tweener"" brands are exactly what we are supposed to be talking about here, I do believe. While I agree that defining a ""near luxury performance sedan"" is difficult, we're kinda going all over the map here.  I guess I've been thinking of ""near luxury"" as ""entry level luxury"" and the reality is they could mean two different things. If you thikn about it, the term NEAR luxury would tend to describe vehicles like the new loaded-up Accords - because of the word near as in ""close to"" - ""close to"" luxury is not entry-level luxury, and I think for the most part entry-level luxury has been the main focus here.  Should we create a price range (how about $32-$42k?) along with a certain level of amenities - leather, premium stereo, climate control, power seat adjustments, upper range of safety features, perhaps navi, available at least as options? What else? How should we quantify ""performance""? I guess that's been a big stumper here, hasn't it.  Should we change the name of this discussion? The opening post here does a great job of explaining the creator's intent, but maybe the name creates a little confusion. cybersol Mar 23, 2002 2:04pm  It would be nice if we could agree on a definition so we could talk about the cars instead of spending so much energy on the focus of the discussion itself! :-)"
540,victord1,March 2004,"It's funny how my '03 Maxima SE has more luxury features (easy entry-exit feature, heated steering wheel, auto-on headlights...)than the '03 TL-S, 3series, and IS300. Now if you think by merely having real wood on the 3series making it more luxurious than the Maxima, then I rest my case....it's an individual thing.  Maybe we should compare cars based on their own merits and not on their perceived images; read brand names."
541,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"Do not agree. It's the placement of the vehicle on a luxury brand's scale that determines if it's a near/entry level lux.  The 3, C, A4, IS300 are all near/entry. They're not luxury cars though. They're the feeders to fill coffers and get brand loyalty. These cars exist at the bottom of a luxury brand's offerings.   Infiniti Lincoln Saab Subaru Volkswagen Volvo  No way in hades is Subaru near anything luxury. Subaru makes economy and joe blow cars. If you sell a car for under 20k there's no way any vehicle from the brand can be considered luxury. It goes against the concept of luxury branding.  As I've stated before, Kmart brand can sell a coat for $5k but in the end it's still a Kmart brand coat.  A Nissan Max loaded to the gills is still from the same brand as the Sentra and Frontier. It may be the most expensive car in that brand but the brand itself is common place.  An entry-level lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brand's offerings. If the brand sells anything approaching economy cars it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entry-level lux. Why is this a tough concept for people?"
542,buddhabman,March 2004,"Infiniti is a brand that has shot up these last two years. Howver prior to that it wasn't very highly considered, particularly in view of its' rebadged vehicles.  Let me admit I am a big Subaru fan. Subaru's are fairly highly regarded, if they weren't why do you see all the AWD and Sportwagons out these days. I will agree that adding it to the Premium segment is touchy, but thats only because of the prior level of interior refinement and powertrain options. The chassis/platforms and worldwide engine drivetrains are considered top notch. The US is finally geting the nicer equipment, plus nicer vehicles are in the works. All the brands seem to be getting into the entry level market, so no problem with Suabru having entry level cars."

BMW dumped the 318ti because it was viewed as diminishing the brand. Read up on the worries from business analysts about the 1 series and MB's bust of a c coupe. As BMW and MB reach more downmarket they risk becoming just another brand like Mazda, Subaru or Chevy. Sales numbers too threaten BMW's branding as they expand.  Lie down with dogs..."
545,victord1,March 2004,"you wrote ""The 3, C, A4, IS300 are all near/entry. They're not luxury cars though."" I agree.  Now about the Kmart thing: are you saying that even if the same objects can be had from Kmart and, say, Neiman Marcus, they're still not the same?!?! Are we talking about placebo effects here??  I think it's only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their ""perceived"" images. After all, we're not comparing brandnames here.......or are we?  Carlisimo, well put. I was thinking of the same thing. Been there, done that, for BMW and MB.......lie down with dogs.  O.K. now all you BMW, MB and Lexus fans can start throwing stones now :-)"
546,dhanley,March 2004,"The whole branding thing makes no sense to me. But what if we said this: a luxury brand is somewhat defined by it's dealerships and service. If you can get service loaners, some period of free service, and the dealerships are attractive and have a good chance of serving cappucino--it's likely a luxury car.  I still think that significant noise(say, low seventies cruising)/shock supression, top-tier safety, amenities such as climate control,leather, heated seats, and respectable power ( say, 0-60 in <8 seconds ) are really requirements for luxury."

I think it's only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their ""perceived"" images. After all, we're not comparing brandnames here.......or are we?  Yes we are.

551,kdshapiro,March 2004,"I agree that modding the engine to increase horsepower is a very viable thing. However:  1. You run the risk of terminating your warranty as the dealer can rightly claim increasing hp/torque with unauthorized mods put undue stree on the engine/driveline components that cause the failure.  2. I do not believe these same mods contribute to an overall increase in gas mileage.  3. You decrease the life and reliability of your vehicle.  But, it is your vehicle, you take your chances and believe what you want about the dealer fixing any engine/drivetrain issues with these mods."
552,dhanley,March 2004,"Well, i don't agree with you at all--but you can be as superficial as you choose.  I still think if you put 100 people in a decked-out camry versus one of the low-end mercs or bimmers you get in europe--the vast majority will pick the camry as more luxurious.  dave"
553,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"They may say the camry feels more luxurious, that doesn't change the impact of branding. Once the brands are revealed most people will change their tune.

If brand is the main qualifier then we couldnt include Phaeton eventho Phaeton is a bit more than just near luxo (bcuz most of its product is non premium vehicle). We have to include all lexus sedans eventho some of them doesnt have 'performance'.  2. If characteristic is the main qualifier then all sedan which qualify as premium/near luxo perf. have to be included too (such as VW Phaeton but not ES330). But then we have to define the term of luxury(unfortunately how hard the car tries to be luxurious, it's brand name tells people otherwise) and maybe we have to define the term of performance too.  3. If price is the main qualifier then STI have to be included if we include G35 based on its stripper price tag. It certainly would include ES330 but not CTS-V. And maybe we have to define what price range that could be considered as the 'premium'  Some people might/-not consider these sedans as premium/near luxury performance sedans: ES330, 1 series, 325i, TSX, Phaeton, CTS-V, new Accord, Subaru STI bcuz of various reasons.

It's not a tough concept. Some people just don't agree with you and your definition.  I agree that there are brands considered ""luxury."" I don't agree that a car must be under such a brand name to be considered an entry luxury vehicle.  Different concept of ""luxury"", I guess."

But a wise buyer should know WHAT he/she is really buying.  Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Subaru.....are not luxury brand , and never will. I never say they are. I'm comparing the luxury aspects car-to-car.  I just hope that we're not going to compare performances of these ""entry luxury"" cars based solely on brands and what those manufacturers claim their products can do.  I have said in other forums that my next car will most likely be a 3series. But that decision is based on factors OTHER THAN the luxury, performance, or brandname aspects of the car.

I would probably go with 330, but don't like the interior, and way to much money."
558,pat,March 2004,"It makes no sense to have a discussion completely consumed with what the belongs in the discussion and what does not.  I think that the suggestion that the entry-level lux category is the lowest sedan offering of a brand that is *generally* accepted as presenting the intent of a ""luxury"" appeal is a good one. I think two good additions to that thought are that the sedan shouldn't exceed the $40-42k'ish range in a common configuration, and that maybe we'll include the 2nd bottom vehicle in some cases (TSX and TL, S40 and S60/S60R).  So I'm exercising my, um, royal power :-), and declaring that this discussion is about the following vehicles:  Acura TSX and TL Audi A4 BMW 3-Series Cadillac CTS Infiniti G35 and maybe I35 Jaguar X-Type Lexus IS 300 and maybe ES 330 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Volvo S60/S60R and maybe S40  I'm not adding Volkswagen for a couple of reasons. Generally speaking, one does not (at least so far) think of that brand when thinking of lux vehicles. There is the Phaeton, but in no way is it in an ""entry level"" class. So the way I see it, it doesn't belong here either way.  I'm changing the name to Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans from Near Luxury Performance Sedans if for no other reason than to make ME feel better about the name! But I'm leaving the ""performance"" part, so feel free to not discuss the ""maybe"" vehicles if you think they don't belong.  If anyone feels strongly that I have overlooked something important, speak up within the next day or so, or forever hold your peace!  Thanks to all of you for your efforts in trying to get this nailed down.  Now, let's talk about cars and not about the discussion! Okay?  :-)"

Up to now I've never, and never will, thought of a 330i as being more luxurious or of better brand than my current Maxima.  You're in the minority on this. I would agree with you but most would feel otherwise. Mention you have a Max and nobody cares.

Good or bad, brand plays a big role in how the majority of the world views products.  More power to the placebo effects. Nuff said. Cheers.

560,pg48477,March 2004,"S60R would probably outperform any car on the list, but it's a bit expensive. I would consider 330 but new model should come out soon. If only TL would come in AWD. I think TL with A-spec would handle as well as 330 performance package, but 5k+installation is to much."
561,cybersol,March 2004,"I find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion focused on what the discussion was about. Reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings.  I think Pat's list is a good one. One addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the Lincoln LS. First of all, Lincoln is obviously meant to be Ford's luxury brand. Secondly, the LS costs between 30-42k in most configurations. Third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions. By all owner accounts, it performs and handles well, even if I personally would not be interested in a Ford product at this time, so that I have not driven one.  Back to talking about cars... If I were shopping today, taking into account that my priorities are size, performance, price, reliability, and then luxury... these SEDANS would be on my shopping list in this order:  1) Infiniti G35 2) Acura TL 3) BMW 330i 4) everything else  Enjoy, cybersol"
562,qbrozen,March 2004,"I said it before, and I'll say it again, i really think this needs to be added.  according to C&D, 0-60 in 6.5 and: In most track trials, the Lincoln set stellar marks. Although it was wearing all-weather tires, usually thought to be a disadvantage, it outran all but the Benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lane-change test. Very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car.  And since the Sport V8 comes in at $40,500 with delivery, the only fault I see with it is the lack of a manual tranny. But I don't see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it."

I ended up ordering a CTS with the luxury/sport package and the dvd navigation system. (blue chip exterior, light gray/ebony interior).  I drove the BMW 3 series and liked its driving characteristics, but didn't care for its styling or interior room. The same can be said for the Mercedes C class..I drove a V6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car, it didn't have the interior space I was looking for.  I very seriously considered the Lexus ES 330, but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly, the handling just wasn't there. The fact that it basically looked like a Camry didn't help either.    I had a bad prior ownership experience with a Honda, so did not consider the acura.    The CTS seemed to have exactly what I was looking for. A quiet comfortable ride combined with excellent handling, plenty of interior space in both the back and front seats, and a very refined smooth and powerful engine. The real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior though...the CTS is one fine looking car from any angle, and doesn't look like just another box on wheels.  I checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so. I'm looking forward to that."

570,fedlawman,March 2004,"Took my TSX to a BMWCCA track event yesterday at Pacific Raceways. Perfect weather, beautiful cars, and a terrific experience.  My FWD 4-banger kept up just fine with all those E46 325's. I lapped more than a few inexperienced drivers piloting E46 330's, and even paced a well driven E36 M3 for one complete lap...what a blast! Then I got a 4 lap ride in a '96 Porsche 911 Turbo. Wow!  What else...two 350Z's were out on the track - they sound awesome (nice throaty exhaust) accelerating down the straight-away and through turn 1. Also, one guy had a late model Lotus Esprit, and there were two WRX STi's out there. One of the STi's was in my group and got behind me, seemingly out of nowhere. I waved him past me after exiting turn 9 and he passed me like I was standing still (I was doing about 60)!  Overall, a terrific club and an awesome day of fun at Pacific Raceways!"
571,kahunah,March 2004,"Last week on the highway, this guy in a WRX STi drove up behind me and was riding my bumper...for a short time. Fed up with his arrogant behavior, I dropped my '04 TL's stick from 5th to 3rd, hit the gas, and left him in the dust, and I didn't even have to floor it. He finally caught up to me, so I did it to him again (6th to 4th). He never did pass me and I'm sure I ruined his day. I won't say how fast I was going but the TL surprised even me."
572,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"two options here:  1. The driver wasn't playing like you were. 2. The guy didn't know how to use turbos. Your V6 with 238lb-ft of torque on a 3400 lb car really isn't a match for a person who knows how to use the sweet spot of their turbos on a car that sports 300 lbs-ft at 4000 rpm and the car weighs 200 lbs less. In fact, it's a one sided affair."
573,fedlawman,March 2004,"I finally had a chance to watch the race this afternoon (I taped it earlier this morning).  It was a very exciting race, and also great to see a brand new car with little development time (TSX) do so well against the established benchmark (325i).  It was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the cars in this competition are, even though there is a combination of FWD and RWD, and ""luxury"" (BMW 325i) vs. ""economy"" (Nissan Sentra).  Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90?"
574,jmess,March 2004,"3. Could be another iteration of the old rope a dope game. Let some dope charge ahead and get nailed by the cop before you get there.

577,jmess,March 2004,"It's like somebody is behind you, so what. You really have several choices: you can ignore them and listen to the nice sterio, you can slow down so they get tired and pass you, you can take the next exit/turn, or you can floor it in an attempt to teach the arrogant so and so a lesson with your car."

""  How does one measure the hp at the crank? IS there a special dyno for this is or did the TL owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank? My guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best. The TL is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not STI beater.  If the STI was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes. The power band of the TL is quite evident in the 50-120 stats and 0-100.. I suggest you take a look at the STI stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 3.2.  ""Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90?

IF someone thinks they are going to enjoy - let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway, I imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough.  The oversteer I paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway - it's enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sight....and carefully pressing the throttle just enough, with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them, with buttery smooth finesse, to slide into the perfect exit angle AND keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather.  Unless you've actually experienced this you will keep wondering!"
579,dhanley,March 2004,"This was gone over several times--SCCA adds balast to cars to make them competitive, and each brand has a minimum weight. It's designed so as to make the drive the issue, not the vehicle.  That being said, i would look at a FWD car next ( i like the new 9-3 ), since i'm willing to sacrifice soem handling for other attributes, but i wouldn't feel the need to fool myself into thinking that wasn't doing so.  dave"
580,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"My bias for RWD comes from that ethereal shove I get when exploding out of a corner just right. Hit the corner perfectly you feel yourself pressed down and back in your seat. Ah, not much like it. I've yet to find that in a FWD car."
581,chrisboth,March 2004,"""Yes, it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer, and perhaps drift your car through a corner, but if you're doing this on public roads, I hope you've driven the road 1000 times, walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as gravel, potholes, debris, etc. that weren't there before, and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out.  Your fantasy is nice and I'm sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your G to ""get a little loose"" and rotate towards some imagined apex (who doesn't?), but that's hardly a defining RWD ""sport sedan"" moment. I can (and do) enjoy the same effect in my FWD Honda.""  ummm i do this 2x a week at least on exit and entrance ramps i can see 360 degrees around. I keep the car loose for about 7-8 seconds all the way around balancing the oversteer and understeer to find the edge of traction - this helps me undertand the limits of the car and how the car reacts to all kinds of inputs. A little spin out (which really wont happen with VDC on) is gonna cause me no problems other than some grass in my springs.  Yu dont have to induce oversteer to get what bluguy describes..the shove. It is something that DOES define the sports sedan's I want to drive - in fact it defines it in such a way that I will never pay more than 20k for a FWD car - more like 18 really.  As far as oversteer you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if RWD in a turn..not much but when the front wheels are turning one way and the other wheels are driving a differnt angle - somthing gives and i assure you it's the rear wheels as they align themselves to the direction of travel to the front...there's just something about the balance you feel as the weight transfers and you propel (shove) down the straight road puit of a turn. No accord can do this man - i'm not sure you really know what this is about."

590,kahunah,March 2004,"blueguydotcom, you obviously don't know what you're talking about. ""Massive torque steer"" doesn't exist in the TL. There is torque steer but it's mild and easily handled."

592,riez,March 2004,"Issue with decent handling powerful FWDers normally isn't oversteer or understeer but torque steer. Laws of physics. Drive wheel and steering wheels one and the same. Plus front heavy. TL, Maxima, etc. all afflicted. Question of extent not existence.  What is up with the discussion tied to racing and tracks? Cars used for racing normally heavily modified, esp. in areas related to handling. Major tire and suspension mods. Everything from shocks, anti-sway bars, cross bracing, bushings, etc. Not to mention that race tracks aren't like regular roads."
593,pg48477,March 2004,"RWD might be more fun for some people to drive, but oversteer just like understeer makes one loose time. TSX and 325 is about the same size and weight, engines about the same size too, and both vehicles manage to post similar lap times.  Big plus for Acura is that they build two different near luxury cars TSX and TL, instead of settle for one platform like BMW and MB did. I know Acura officials said that TL was build as a competition for 5- series, but we all know that size and price wise it should and is being compared with 3-series. New RL on the other hand should be grate competition for 5 and E."
594,pg48477,March 2004,"Do you have PHD in physics? What kind of law is that? I know physics well, but never heard of such law. You can probably steer your car and shift gears at the same time, according to your logic it should be to much to handle. We all should be drivin AT than:)"
595,jmess,March 2004,"As mentioned HP to weight ratio and gearing can really make a difference in who gets to a corner first. Once you get there you can block the folks behind you at the point where they may have a handling advantage. As long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there, you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly. Track configuration can also favor one car over another.  To really make a FWD race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer. We used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer. Once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard. So you take an earlier apex than a RWD car, induce some oversteer via lift throttle and/or trail braking, then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner. With some practice and the right balance it can be a lot of fun if you don't overheat the front tires or brakes during the race."
596,buddhabman,March 2004,"When were looking at cars we tested the X-Type. I like the exterior but the inside wasn't impressive but not as bad as the Mondeo/Taurus people are making it out to be. I hope they can fix this car. I read this from AutoSpies  ""Hot X-Type R seen testing   The long awaited X-Type R model, due late 2004 or early 2005ish, has been seen cruising the West Midlands of England during final testing. The four-wheel drive R will have the latest version of Jaguar's V6 engine, using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb. ft of torque. There has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged R formula, for it could well be turbocharged instead, due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet. The 3.0-litre engine could also be expanded to 3.2 litres and 250bhp, an upgrade likely to debut in the whole X-Type range.   0-60 acceleration is said to be around the five-second mark, and top speed nudging 165 mph. Jaguar's new six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission will be standard, though no news on a Tiptronic/SMG style box - Jaguar preferring the J-Gate. The R will stand out with it's enlarged bumpers, huge exhaust pipes, mesh front grille, de-chromed exterior and 19-inch alloy wheels, but no silly body kit or boot spoilers. Unlike the other R's, it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet. Internally the car will remain the same as the other models, save for material/wood differences, until the whole car gets a face lift in 2006."""
597,fedlawman,March 2004,"Sorry to ignore you, it's just that your ""handicap"" theory doesn't make one bit of difference.  The SCCA rules are not used in the Speed Challenge, but Speed Challege has it's own rules to make the racing tight and exciting by equalizing the various cars. Thus, the 325i and TSX begin with similar power:weight and the same tires (brand, size, and compound).  The cars in this series are indeed heavily modified for racing, but the fact remains that FWD is FWD and RWD is RWD...and they both perform. Is FWD was truly inferior in some way, then Realtime Racing could have entered a BMW instead of the Acura. They chose the TSX because of it's an outstanding platform to build a race car on."
598,fedlawman,March 2004,"""you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if RWD in a turn""  If your tires are gripping, then you aren't sliding. And if you're a good driver, your car is always ""set"" so that each tire is getting maximum contact with the road.  I get much more satisfaction from nailing the apex perfectly and tracking out with the car in perfect balance. What you're describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights."
599,riez,March 2004,"pg48477... If you want to learn more about torque steering in powerful FWDers, then just read about any review of the Maxima, TL, Sentra SE-R Spec V, Neon SRT-4.  Manufacturers try to overcome the laws of physics related to this problem by many things. Two most basic are (1) LSD (critical for powerful FWDers) and equal length half-shafts. If one wheel transmits more power to the ground than the other, it will pull the FWD car to one side because the drive wheels are also the steering wheels."

I'd rather have a great handling RWD car that just needs a little boost in power, power is easy aneasy fix in a car. What's harder to do is to make a car like the TL that has good HP but very mediocre in handling & to try to make that FWD car handle & drive better than an IS, a G35 or 3 series"

Only one mag placed TL 3rd. Sorry I dont even know where IS was, I never like the car.  You may say TL's handling is very mediocre bcuz you dont own one.

611,fedlawman,March 2004,"In this forum, to use terms like, ""slow,"" ""mediocre,"" ""underpowered,"" ""small,"" etc. is just ignorant.  The 170 hp A4 1.8T is neither slow nor underpowered.  The TL's handling is certainly better than mediocre.  The C230K engine is not small.  Every car in this class is capable of above average acceleration and handling, and possesses poise, balance, elegance, and luxury that trumps the average commuter car.  Sure a Honda Accord V-6 can outrun an Audi A4 in a straight line. However, the Accord does not handle as well, look as good, offer certain luxury features, and it isn't as exclusive.  These characteristics are what define this class of cars...it's about the total package."
612,kdshapiro,March 2004,"""How about CR mag who placed the TL 1st over 330i""  You are correct, but what did it place it in first for. Not for handling. However, handling is just one characteristic of a car. People value different aspects of a cars nature. Notice the Lexus ES330 was down on the list, has nothing to do with how the car sells or how good a car is in the publics perception, or what we think of a car here at Edmunds. That is only CRs opinion of a car.  I like CR, but when making a CAR buying decision, I leave home without it."
613,riez,March 2004,"fedlawman... For once we concur completely. You wrote, ""These characteristics are what define this class of cars...it's about the total package.""  But the ""total package"" is the whole nine yards. It includes:  -price -equipment -basic platform -acceleration, handling, braking, steering -reliability/quality -warranty -ownership costs -safety -depreciation/resale value -functionality/practicality/utility -sales/service experience  It is as a total package that the IS300 shines. Great price. Great standard (HID) and optional equipment (LSD). Great platform, including RWD, IRS, and manual transmission. Great overall performance. Fantastic reliability/quality. Great warranty (both b-to-b and powertrain with optional mfr extension to b-to-b). Good ownership costs (though insurance a bit too high). Great safety, including crash test results. Decent depreciation. Good practicality, if a bit smallish. One of the best sales/service experiences in the industry.  It is the little things that can make the big difference. Can you get LSD? Mine does. Does your manufacturer sell its own extended b-to-b warranty? Mine does, out to 7yr/100k."
614,speedracer3,March 2004,"It's great that IS300 fullfils your needs, the negatives why I personally would not consider an IS are as follows:  1) un-Lexus like interior. The word Corolla comes to mind. 2) Boy racer styling. Subjective, but it is not my cup of tea. 3) Bang for the buck. Considering that a more powerful G35 can be had for the same money makes the IS300 slightly overpriced."

616,kahunah,March 2004,"As far as total packages go, the G35 and the TL blow the IS completely out of the water, into outer space.  As for sales figures, if the cars compared are closely matched in terms of category, class, equipment, price range, etc., then sales figures are very relevant in determining a car's overall success, and at close to 7,000 units per month, the TL is king!"
617,fedlawman,March 2004,"Of course you are completely correct, and that is why the IS300 is the perfect car for you.  I strongly considered the IS300 too, but not to sound like a broken record, I didn't like the boy racer styling either, and the relatively cheap and contrived interior turned me off.  My TSX has 99% of the performance of the IS300, yet has a much nicer and higher quality interior (IMO), a smoother quieter ride on the highway (IMO), and a more dynamic and exciting engine/transmission combo (IMO).  Let's face it, no one car is better than another car here, so stop trying to convince everyone that the IS300 is the cat's meow. For you, it may be, but I took a pass...different strokes."
618,raher,March 2004,"Sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer. In the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer's defined return on investment. Sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model. Sales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. The wholesale increase in HP across most of the models in this discussion is an example. I am amused by the comments I see here insinuating that ""Joe Blow"" buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as ""different"". Superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. That marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. Ferrari does not have the same sales goals as Honda, Nissan, Toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them. You can't discount sales as a very important indicator. The reference to McDonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. It doesn't matter if Joe Blow eats there and you don't. Other businesses would kill for McDonald's success in their market. Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. The marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. It will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future. Navigation systems weren't on any cars a few years ago. The sales figures for the new TL reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that Acura is on the right track with their blend of styling, handling, performance etc. The new Acuras will drive changes to BMW , Nissan , Toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new TL.. Competition is also a wonderful thing. The consumer wins in the end. Most of the discussion on this board is ""my car is better than your car"" supported by whatever article, personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position. No one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated. It is always interesting to hear from the participants here however and many of the opinions are put forth from an obvious informed background. I learn a lot here and also laugh a lot. God bless the internet."
619,danny1878,March 2004,"You can always bring up accord, camry or McDonald, but the fact is they are in different market segments.  If you want to buy a $33k-$40k car, would certainly expect good features, good handling, good performance. Will they buy an Accord/Camry? nope. Bcuz they expect more than that with that much money. So if you say sales fgures has nothing to do with quality, buy some marketing books.  If you were a car manufacturer, would you produce a car where you dont need to sell it? Not with Lexus, BMW or Infinity. They wont survive if if they dont sell the car"
620,riez,March 2004,"fedlawman... You wrote, ""the general consensus is that the TSX 6-speed is a low-to-mid seven second car and the automatic adds about 1/2 second to that.

Two results are close (8.1 and 7.9) with the C&D 7.2 being the exception. C&D's number is adjusted for conditions so we don't know what the actual track result was. Doesn't appear R&T has tested a TSX, yet. Anyone got data from AutoWeek? Has CR tested one?  Seems like the published data would have TSX manual around 8.0. No idea about automatic, but think it possible it might add up to 1 second (ATs tend to sap smallish low torque I4s)--which would be in line with what AT did with Integra."
621,speedracer3,March 2004,I don't the the A4 1.8T is slow at all. For a 4 banger it is extremely quick. Comparing it to or an I6 or a V6 is unfair.
622,shipo,March 2004,"""Comparing it to or an I6 or a V6 is unfair.""  Why?  If you take a 1.8 liter four banger and apply only 7.45 PSI of boost, you will have an engine that should exactly equal the output of that same 1.8 mill with two more cylinders added. Sounds like a 2.7 liter I6 or V6 to me. Then again, if I'm not mistaken, Audi has the waste gate on the 1.8t set MUCH higher than 7.45 PSI, that should put it into the 3+ liter range as far as output is concerned.  Best Regards, Shipo"
623,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"I don't the the A4 1.8T is slow at all.  That's why they make different cars for all of us. I owned a 1.8T it was a fun, punchy little engine.  For a 4 banger it is extremely quick.  Stop right there. I don't rate things on a scale of ""for a....[insert modifier] it was good."" Either it's good or not. In the realm of engines either it produces enough power to satisfy me or it doesn't. On a scale of 1-10 I'd put the 1.8T at about a 6. Still a failing grade. don't worry, my ZHP's engine would only rate about a 7.5 or so. An 8 would be too generous.  Comparing it to or an I6 or a V6 is unfair.  No it's not. I'm comparing it against all engines. BTW, it competes in a class with 6's. And if it's any consulation after driving a 325i I knew I couldn't buy it partly because I felt power wise that would be a lateral move from my 1.8T. Why spend 30k to get the same power output (with less useable torque too) that I had on my 21k car?!"
624,speedracer3,March 2004,"I was talking about a stock 1.8T. A chipped 1.8T is another story. For $400 an APR Stage I chip gives the A4 around 200hp, but the car can easily be tuned to ~250hp."
625,speedracer3,March 2004,"Let's put it this way. the 1.8T is faster than most I4's and it feels like a V6. So yes, I do quantify my remark, for a small I4 it has tremendous punch. I think the HP figures on the 1.8T are underrated. I have a Mazda Millenia with a 2.5L V6 and my A4 leaves the Mazda in it's dust. Not only that but as I mentioned above, spend a few hundred dollars on a chip and even V6's can be had for lunch."
626,shipo,March 2004,"I was talking about a bone stock 1.8t. That thing should be running something like 8-11 PSI of boost which should give it at least the same output as any decent 2.5 liter normally aspirated engine currently on the market. To take it to 200HP, my ballpark guess that it would need maybe 14-17 PSI and to take it to 250HP would require boost of somewhere north of 20 PSI.  Like it or not, it is absolutely fair to compare a blown 1.8 to a larger normally aspirated engine ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 liters.  Best Regards, Shipo"
627,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"I wrote a review of my Jetta every month and I consistently praised the 1.8T. That said, it didn't offer the punch I wanted from my fun car. But yes, it's a fun darn engine. Like I said, I'd choose it over a BMW inline 2.5 any day and twice on sunday.  Of course, I'd rather the 2.4 of the TSX over either of them.  Until you chip...wow 240 lb-ft of torque! Yummy."
628,pjj14,March 2004,"After test driving almost all of the cars in the sport sedan/near luxury class on several different occasions, I have finally narrowed my choices to the Lexus IS 300 and the Acura TSX. As such, I would appreciate any feedback or information board members may have regarding their experiences with either of these cars.  Though Washington D.C. winters are not normally that bad, I am most concerned about the Lexus's RWD. Thus, any experiences with the IS 300 in the ice and/or snow would be helpful. Thanks in advance."
629,speedracer3,March 2004,"Shipo,  So do you agree with Blue's statement that the 1.8T has no guts?  Blue,  I was not wowed by the TSX's 2.4L I4. No doubt it is quick on launch, but take it on the highway (as I did) and the engine feels strained. The A4 1.8T won't win drag races, but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home. Don't get me wrong, I liked the TSX very much, but to me it looked and felt too much like another Accord."
630,blueguydotcom,March 2004,"The A4 1.8T won't win drag races, but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home.  That's funny as we're so different. On the freeway I loathed the 1.8T as I found it loud and in the case of the Jetta, poorly geared. With an A4 I also found the 1.8T to be too noisy. It's like a hornet's nest on the freeway.  The TSX on the other hand had a nice long 6th that I could slip into and let the car glide along. Then again, I prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when I'm on the freeway and I want power in my ZHP. In 6th, I'm cruising and therefore I want it as quiet and loafing as possible. The taller the gear the better. 2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the TSX very much, but to me it looked and felt too much like another Accord.  I'm not a honda fan, so I didn't see or feel anything accordish in my times with the TSX."
631,shipo,March 2004,"Do I think that it has no guts (talking about the 170 HP version)? Hmmm, I guess that depends on what it's mounted in. Mounted in a light weight car, say 2,600 pounds, I think it would be great, however, if it is mounted in a 3,400 pound sedan, then no, I don't think it is up to the task.  Best Regards, Shipo"
632,riez,March 2004,Keep in mind the TSX uses a dragstrip-like 4.73:1 final drive. That gives it the initial launch. It also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive. The 6th overdrive is very deep at 0.66:1.  The IS300 uses 3.73:1 final and 0.85: 5th.  BMW has been using direct drive 5th (1.00:1) in past E46 323i/325i with various final drives under 3.50:1. The new 6-speeds bring overdrive. [My '98 540i6 had a .82 overdrive 6th with a 2.82:1 final drive.]
633,speedracer3,March 2004,I think the 1.8T offers very spirited driving for frontrack models. The combination of frontrack and 6 speed or CVT work well also. I think the added weight of Quattro and the Tiptronic is a perfomace killer for the 1.8T. If I wanted Quattro I would have chosen the A4 3.0
634,blueguydotcom,March 2004,Yeah the tip and quattro suck the life out of the poor 1.8T. I meet people in San Diego with that combo and I wonder why they'd need the Quattro HERE.
635,merc1,March 2004,"I take it you guys are talking about manual transmissions in the A4 1.8t and TSX, because with an automatic they are slooower than I don't know what. I couldn't believe how slow the A4 1.8t was on a recent test drive. With the air running a foot to the floor wouldn't induce a kickdown. I thought the car was malfunctioning. If I get an A4 it will have to be the 3.0 model.  M"
636,ryanl1,March 2004,"Thanks to everyone (almost) on this site I've learned more about their favourite cars and what they dislike about other cars.I haven't decided what car to buy but have narrowed it to a list that I would be more than happy to own.  Keeping in mind that everyone's priorities are different when choosing a car it would be interesting to know from all the regulars what would have been their second choice and why from my list below:  Acura TL (Danny1878 great car but do I really need navi,dvd,bluetooth?) Acura TSX (Fedlawman a better value than TL but does it have enough power?) Infinity G35 (Chrisboth beautful car but interior upgrade for 05 coming) Lexus IS300 (Riez reliability king with flair but needs refreshing) Suburaru Legacy GT 2005 (saw it at the autoshow...a new contender?) Volvo S60 (can't get this Ford thing outta my head) Honda Accord,Mazda 6s,Nissan Altima (last resort safe family choices without putting one to sleep)  I haven't chosen any German cars because reliability is a major issue.Please don't be offended KD,blueguy,speedracer as I love all your cars but can't afford to get a new car every 2 to 4 years."
637,speedracer3,March 2004,Which A4 1.8T combo did you drive?.
638,qbrozen,March 2004,"My second choice, right now, would be a tossup between the '05 Legacy GT and '05 S40 T5 6-speed (just as big on the inside as the S60 but handles far better). BUT, have not driven or sat in either one yet, so this is all based on numbers, reviews, and pics. So its pretty much a worthless opinion at this point."
639,blueguydotcom,March 2004,The TL can be purchased without the navi. Now you're talking 32k or so. Great deal.  I love power and I think the 6 speed tsx w/o navi is a screaming deal. Keep the engine over 4k and it pulls strongly.
640,chillenhonda,April 2004,"I read these boards hoping to gain useful knowledge about the cars and to learn about people's opinions based on their test drives, their experiences, and what they've learned from going to dealerships and auto shows.  Im not interested, and I dont think many other people are either, in some posters' biases, speculation, or uneducated bank-and-forth chatter. It isnt very helpful."
641,cheerioboy26,April 2004,"Good point about sales. I'll just toss in FWIW that after two years, the G35 sedan sales of 4,247 were the highest ever. Only one previous month, Aug. 03, over 4K."

If it doesn't have a manual, what's the point of the car? That's like a house without plumbing."
645,mariner7,April 2004,"The numbers for Nissan and Mazda in a way are deceptive, they're just making up ground lost to Toyota and Honda in the 90's. And they still have some way to go! With the recent success of Nissan/Mazda, you can bet Toyota/Honda are going to pay much more attention to exterior designs from now on.  The euro is really hurting the Euros in these incentive laden times. The Swedes don't use the euro, do they? Maybe that's why Volvo sales are increasing compared to the Germans.  Who's at VW going to stop the bleeding?"
646,billyperks,April 2004,offers a lot of rebates on their product so that kind of explains why they are to able to move that much units.

What does that tell you about Honda products?

654,speedracer3,April 2004,"Though this may be true, they ultimately end up with the best products.  I think you are talking about Toyota who is still taking Honda to the cleaners every year while Nissan is slowly narrowing the margin for the #2 spot."

660,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"You are wrong blueguydotcom, I said 15k unit in March 2002(that was the highest record but not for the whole year), and for Accord, 31-38k units was it's monthly sales. Anyway 105k/year is less than 9k/months while accord 31-38k/month.  Honda sold 31k V6 Accords in a month?! Check your stats, as that's just not possible. In fact, if you broke it down it was probably more like 6k V6 accords, maximum.  Again you guys are trying to compare different item, diff. segment, diff. creature. I am talking about entry-level-luxu.-perf. sedan not burger, not truck f150, not camry(family sedan),not autohomes, not toilet, not software, not watches etc.  It's all the same. My house, just like my BMW, my computer and the salmon in the fridge is just a product.  Sorry boss, I didnt know that I cant quote sales figure, 0-60, 0-100, 1/4 mile, LSD, Voice command, DVD-A, 60-0, etc. I have tried so hard to find something bad about the car but so far only RWD feelings. That's not even allowed in this discussion here. Is this called Car enthusiast's discussion? lol.  Quote all you want. It seems people are desperate for others to approve of their purchase. It's not good enough that you like the car, it seems important that 7k people this month did too. This is akin to people who cite box office as proof a movie is good. $1.8 billion in box office doesn't mean a film's good by default and 7k sales in a month doesn't either. The Accord sold 30k+ cars last month, I'll flat out say it, the Accord is not a good car. So 30K people made a bad decision? Maybe not for them, but I found it bulky, wallowy and just not a fun experience. On a scale of 1/10, the Accord would rank about 3 or 4 for me.  TL is the only FWD that can compete with 330i, G35, RWDer.  True, so what do sales have to do with that? I like the TL. I do not like the stigma that goes with BMW buyers and I'm not digging the vibe I'm getting from some TL buyers in here too. This reminds me of the attitude when the G35 arrived (KD I bet you remember those posts) and many G35 owners were not content to love their cars - they wanted the world to nod and say, ""You got a great deal on a BMW beater."" Time has passed and now the G35's just another legit option (unlike previous Infinitis). You don't see that attitude as much with the G. But boy has it come on strong with the TL.  So for you, you got a great deal. The TL is a wonderful car, love it for what it does for you. How do others feel about it? Does it matter? Unless they're buying you the car, what anyone else thinks of your purchase should not be relevant.  Being the best selling car in any class is a useless stat when it comes to making your buying decision. You don't automatically buy the bestselling of other products do you? So, why would it matter with a stupid toy?"
661,speedracer3,April 2004,"Danny  Sorry for being a little too personal by mentioning audi sales. I like it's stying and comfort. :-)  You can quote sales all you want. I love my A4, and I don't care if they sell 2 or 200K Audis. As a matter of fact the whole VW/Audi division is in the toilet right now. So?. I lease my car, when the lease is over if I like another Audi I'll get it, or if not I'll get something else.  More on the TL. the recent Motor Trend comparo commented that steering was overboosted, torque steer was evident, brakes were worse in the group, and the turning circle is huge, equivalent to Dodge Ram truck. Doesn't say sport sedan to me...just a guzzied up Honda Accord with a big engine."
662,kdshapiro,April 2004,"I fully agree if you classify the TL as an average family car and classify the 330i as an average family car, the TL would probably win as a vehicle more people would want to drive. But if that concept is extended you get back to Ford Taurus as the pre-eminent family car. I can see how CR could think the TL has more *utility* than a 330i.  But now if one is talking near luxury sports sedans, FWD fall short. The recent R&T review seems to echo some of the sentiment of torque steer.  Yes the TL may have more *utility* than a 330i, but it is not a better sports sedan. That's why CR got it wrong. It doesn't matter how many TLs are sold, each one of them comes with a little bit of torque-steer.  Yes, ""I'll have my sports sedan: torque-steer to go!"""
663,designman,April 2004,"Blueguy… can't figure out how you hate FWD yet like the TL. Tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the TL has going for itself.  Curious how there's no mention of drive type for the FWD cars on the Acura website. The only places where drive type is documented are with NSX(RWD) and MDX(4WD). Seems to be tacit admission of the growing sentiment against it, and that reports of Acura migration to AWD is most believable and to be expected.  The new TL seems to be real popular and is becoming ubiquitous, but FWD is getting incredibly negative PR… must present a major headache for the manufacturers who have years of equity in it.  Here's a bit of this negative PR:  http://slate.msn.com/id/2081194/"
664,raher,April 2004,"I am not sure that the link provided convinces me that FWD is getting a lot of negative PR. Mickey Knaus ( whoever he is ) isn't someone who I am willing to accept as having a lot of influence in the marketplace or anywhere for that matter. That conclusion became apparent when I saw his source for most of what he is stating as his opinion was a GM suspension expert. GM experts on suspension ? The expert must have based his dissertation on those terrific suspensions on Buicks. People here keep dissing the sales figures. The sales figures are much more of realistic indicator of the buying publics acceptance or rejection of FWD automobiles. The TL is out selling all of the RWD cars that Pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans. I don't believe the majority of car buyers care as much about FWD versus RWD as the very small number of participants on this board do. I know the people here who believe they are different because they don't buy cars lots of other people do will take exception. Taking exception is certainly their right but it doesn't alter the fact that Acura continues to manufacture and sell a lot of really fine FWD cars in a class dominated by RWD cars. The reason is they give a lot of value for the money and that seems to be more important to people than what kind of drivetrain the car has. Pat has sent me to the penalty box lately so I have to be a kinder, gentler commentator. It 's against my nature."

Or the attitude of BMW owners that the 3 was still the ""better"" car. They wanted the world to say, ""The 3 is still the king of its class.""  TL owners point to sales and accolades, I remember 3 owners doing exactly the same thing."
666,kdshapiro,April 2004,"""The TL is out selling all of the RWD cars that Pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans.""  There is nothing inherently wrong with FWD. Sales only has to do with popularity, not best of breed. Even CR says the TL is basically a ""torted up"" (sic) Accord.  jrock - nobody is not saying the TL is not a good car. It offers good ""value"" for the money. You can point to the accolades fair enough as long as you point to criticsms. One of the big ones is torque-steer. Now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual. But the question is, how acceptable is it in the near-entry level sports sedan segment?  The G35 debate was different in that it got down to the precision handling of a 330 vs the more ""family oriented value"" of the G35 with less ""precision and finesse"". And again those types of differences are open to a wide range of different opinions in a public forum such as Edmunds. But it depends on your priority in an automobile."
667,pg48477,April 2004,"kd, don't kid yourself 330 is not a sport sedan either. Sales figures basically show how many people prefer one car over another. In case of Near luxury (G35, 330,TL and so on) TL is a best seller and so more people than not think it's the best in the class, that is why they buy it. Now, we all have different opinion, but at the end the majority wins.  blue, What difference does it make V6 or not, Honda sells more Accords than Altima and Maxima combined, so what's your point. Plus Altima is total garbage even compared with basic Accord. Strong V6 does not make car much better, espacialy in family sedan category."
668,jrock65,April 2004,"There were many, many, many different G35 vs. 3 debates.  I was just referring to the fact that just as many G35 owners looked for ""approval"" from the world, so did many 3 owners in defending the 3.  It's interesting that you mention that one must point out criticisms of the TL. I don't remember you criticizing the 3 a single time for anything. Correct me if I'm wrong.  How acceptable is torque steer in the entry level performance car segment? It depends on how you define a entry level performance car. To me, it is definitely one of the biggest weaknesses of the TL in the light of being considered a ""performance sedan.""  How's the X3 purchase going? Did you get it yet?"
669,hoyahenry,April 2004,"The 'FWD-is-bad-torque-steer-proves-it-camp' have yet to answer the So what? question. I'll accept the torque steer to no-drive during periods of inclement weather. In good weather, just give it a little ""more right rudder"" and go - and it does go.  In other words, I want year-round, versatile performance; FWD is aces when the weather goes in the can, and the TL makes it easy to get a high performance, highly versatile, luxury platform.  If torque steer is the trade off, I'm all for it. To me, the advantages of FWD far outweigh the negative perception of torque steer."
670,shipo,April 2004,"You know, I too bought the FWD=""Better in Snow Argument"" back in the late 1970s. For many years there was no one who could convince me otherwise. Then in 1999 I bought a 328i and found that with the standard issue All-Season tires it was nearly as good as my 1995 Passat in slippery conditions. Since then I have both moved to New Hampshire (where we had 114"" of snow last winter) and upgraded to a 530i, which I equipped with winter tires. Simply put, the 530i, when shod with my winter wheel/tire set, is the finest winter driving vehicle I have ever had the pleasure to push through inclement conditions.  The fact is that the RWD cars discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar FWD car running Summer tires or even All-Seasons for that matter. For my money, THAT is what truly constitutes versatile performance.  As for torque steer, I am really glad that I don't have to put up with that anymore. Oh how I hated torque steer!

674,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"V6? I never said its only V6, Maxima vs Accord .  If you're not comparing V6 to V6 sales, then you're using a dubious metric. The Max is offered as the top end of the midsize range from Nissan. The 4 banger accord is specifically designed to appeal to a different buyer. Do you not grasp that? The vast majority of buyers don't give a hoot about handling, power or performance - thus the reason cars like the ES330, Accord and Fords/GMs sell well.  Do you think all those 7k people had their decision from sales figures  The truth? I think price, Honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of TL sales and always have. A comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more. To most buyers, imho, the lack of RWD would mean nothing to them as they buy appliances. When I help friends/family buy cars and they're looking to drop 30-40k, the general statements are, I need something reliable, something pretty luxurious, its got to have a little power.  So I'll take them out and if they drive a 33k version of a G35, TL, A4 and 325i they'll walk away most impressed by the price/power/equipment of the G, TL. Only one person still wanted the 325 over the past two years...he fell in love with the handling but he drives cars hard (G was number 2 for him fwiw).  designman Blueguy… can't figure out how you hate FWD yet like the TL. Tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the TL has going for itself.  I recognize the excellent value. Look at all you get for that scary low price! If I'd gone TL (which was not out last year in May), I'd have saved a big chunk of change and had a car that would offer probably 90% of what I got (minus of couse the more useless visual and tactile cues I prefer on the 3 series). If money or equipment had been the primary determining factor in my purchase I would have gotten the TSX (remember no TL then).  In the end I fell for the roar of the motor, the the pull of the 6, solid turn-in and the bone-jarring ride of my ZHP"
675,hoyahenry,April 2004,"Careful. I drove a 325 and 528 all over central MA and NH for many years! We both know that the weather there chooses the time and place it wants to make a mess, and that may not be in synchronous harmony with when (or where) we finally have the opportunity to switch out the tires for the conditions.  At the end of the day, it is physically impossible to fish tail a fwd car unless it is going in reverse, up hill. Moreover, with a good set of all season tires and fwd, there's nothing to do if it snows 3 feet one week and happens to be 70 the next."
676,kahunah,April 2004,"""The fact is that the RWD cars discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar FWD car running Summer tires or even All-Seasons for that matter. For my money, THAT is what truly constitutes versatile performance.""  Nice try with the apples and oranges comparison. The fact is, my TL with winter tires can run circles around your 530i, any day of a winter week."
677,kdshapiro,April 2004,"""The fact is, my TL with winter tires can run circles around your 530i, any day of a winter week.""  Okay I'll take you up on it. Having recently been in a RWD Mercedes with winter tires in the snow. I can say it ruled. Would have definitely outhandled any FWD car even with snows."
678,shipo,April 2004,"For me and the kind of driving that I do, there is no replacement for RWD, unless there is a properly balance (meaning power AND weight) AWD solution available. Regarding when the weather does its worst, I have opted for the Michelin Arctic-Alpin tires, and while they are no match for the summer set that I have, they are easily the dry road handling equal of a typical set of All-Season tires. As such, I don't need to replace them until mid to late April.  Regarding the new TL (a design by the way that is what, 8 years newer than my 530i), yes, I have no doubt that it will out accelerate my 530i in snowy conditions, however, given its front end bias, I'd bet that the 530i will stop shorter and probably handle better. Nope, I find it highly unlikely that it would run rings around the 530i.  Best Regards, Shipo"

683,gpwatfrd,April 2004,"Take one article out of one magazine and that justifies the TL's brakes being more than adequate. I don't think so...   You can not use sales volume to justify the TL being a great car. I read in an earlier post about McDonalds being at the top of the fast food chain. They are... along with many of franchises. Why? Not because of product. It is all branding. Why has Madonna done so well for such a long time. Is she the best singer you ever heard, no of course not. It is all branding.  You need a good car not the best of the bunch to be a big hit and that is what the TL is. How well you market that automobile will take care of the rest.  The TL is NOT the second coming of Christ as some people hear lead us to believe."
684,chrisboth,April 2004,Theres a reason to buy one. I think these are the types of comnments that inadvertantly give some people confindence in thier purchase where there should be none.  The G35 standard package brakes are seemingly the best on any sports sedan short of an M. Why: Almost every tester (not just one) raved about the stopping power and 1 even mentioned that just one italian supercar came to the same stopping distance as the G sedan.  When one says they are porsche worthy but the rest say so-so or not so great...that's why they all have to be taken with a grain..
685,mariner7,April 2004,That's why I want to see data on the other FWD's with big V6. Throw in Avalon/Camry too. I want to see if it's a Honda thing or a big FWD thing.
686,kahunah,April 2004,"None of the cars mentioned on this board are the ""second coming"". Many on this board just can't face the fact that TL offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this category...end of story!"
687,shipo,April 2004,"I guess it depends upon your perspective. For my tastes, FWD cars need not apply. In fact, AWD cars are only considered after being given a seriously ""Hairy Eyeball"". In my book, and remember I am a staunch BMW supporter; the best bang for the buck on the market these days is the G35.  Best Regards, Shipo"

689,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"Many on this board just can't face the fact that TL offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this category...end of story!  But for many people, the best buy for the buck isn't the best option. Some want the best for the limit they set. I didn't care that BMW was over 40k, only that it satisfied 80% of my desire for a price I found acceptable. The TL, if it had been out, would have hit about 75-77%. The price difference wasn't enough to make me look to the TL. If the 330i had come in at 50k and I hadn't swung the deal I got, maybe the TL would win out.  Price wasn't the final determining factor though. Sorry. If I cared about bang for the buck in 03, I would gone for an STI and just obliterated pretty much all non supercars in my path."
690,kahunah,April 2004,"Which is exactly why I chose the TL over BMW 3 and G35! The 3 fell short on interior room and value for the money, and I couldn't live with the poorly contrived G interior. The TL on the other hand far exceeded my requirements.  As for RWD performance, who but a few of you really care? I drive in the real world with pot holes, speed limits and traffic congestion not 'Racetrack Fantasy Land'. The so-called benefits of RWD were just not worth the compromises I would of had to make with the any of the other cars mentioned above."

My Perf ZHP with leather and xenons - no navi as that's the most useless thing since the fanny pack - had a sticker of 43k. I paid a few hundred below 40k for it.  What is the Perf ZHP? The name of the options package?  Anyways, I based the price on the MSRP and noticed that the Edmunds' own TMV prices weren't that far off the MSRP, only a few hundred.  Of course everyone is going to try to shave more than a few hundred off the MSRP."

697,shipo,April 2004,"Hmmm, the only time I've done that in the last 25 years it was on purpose. We live at the end of a cul-de-sac and had a very nice snow covering of six inches or so, so I switch off the DSC and nailed it. I had the kids in back and they had a ball watching all of the snow slinging out the back with the car driving sideways around the circle. I made four or five circuits before we got bored and went in for dinner. ;-)  Prior to that, I've only ""Spun Out"" unintentionally twice, once in a RWD 1970 Dodge Challenger with bald rear tires (Hmmm, I wonder why they were bald? :-)), in wet conditions no less, and the other was in my 1979 Scirocco on dry pavement. Oh my! Isn't the Scirocco a FWD car? Yup! Even so, I entered an on-ramp a little too hot and managed to accidentally perform a complete 540 before coming to a stop facing back up the ramp. Oops!  Like it or not, with modern traction control, it is virtually impossible to get the back end to hang out, even on purpose, unless you switch off the electronics.  I got my drivers license thirty years ago and I have extensive experience driving AWD, FWD and RWD cars in horrible conditions on roads all over the world, and FWIW, I feel much safer driving fast in slippery conditions in a car where the front wheels aren't at the mercy of engine power as to whether or not they have any grip.

702,mariner7,April 2004,"""What did Acura find out?  That their bank account is overflowing with record sales of the TL.  I guess you meant to say what Infiniti found out.

703,shipo,April 2004,"The good news is that the issues that I've had with my last two cars are really nothing more than nits so to speak, no show stoppers. ;-)  Issues with the 2002 530i:  1) It too has the steering wheel blocking the top of the speedo issue. 2) Adaptive throttle by wire software takes a bit getting used to, I prefer a simple linear throttle. 3) Tire noise as the OEM Pilot-Primacys wear. 4) The space taken up with the silly sliding arm rest could have easily been used for a small storage console. 5) For about 500 miles or so I was bumping against that arbitrary 128 mph speed governor while on the AutoBahn. The car clearly has more legs than that. 6) Cup holders that are so ridiculous that I actually forgot my car even had any (real low priority issue for me anyway). 7) Brake dust.  Issues with the 1999 328i:  1) DING! When ever the OAT hit 37 degrees the display would change and DING at me, forcing me to acknowledge the information by pushing a button or else my chosen display would be stuck on the OAT. 2) No two zone HVAC. The 1998 E36 328i had it, my 530i has it, and even our two Dodge Caravans have it. I like it cool, my wife likes it hot and the 328i was difficult to deal with when we were both in the car. 3) The 128 mph governor, not that I ever felt its influence on this car, at least legally anyway. ;-) 4) Brake dust.  Best Regards, Shipo"
704,danny1878,April 2004,"Sorry ES is no longer the top seller, look at the previous 2 months sales figures. Suddenly ES sales matters now. hmmm :-)  I dont think TL is more luxurious than ES."
705,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"My how things have changed...as I have an 03 330i  2) 80mph=3500RPM ( not that loud, but gas? ) 80 mph in 6th gear - we're talking over 30 mpg and around 3k with almost 4k more to go.  3) Air cond not enough for five people in new mexico on hot day day. Takes time to cool car even in chicago.  Open the windows and doors remotely. By the time I get to the car it's air temp. Within 2-3 minutes it's an ice box.  4) Paint seems to chip/scratch easier than on my old saturn ( and, i mean, come on )  Your saturn was plastic wasn't it? Isn't that injection molded? Anyway, 1 year, 15k miles not a scratch on the whole car.  5) Cupholder specifically designed to hold no cup in the universe.  Will take just about any cup known to man - though nobody better sip anything in my car or they'll die.  Guess BMW did improve things.  Things that aren't good with my 330i: 1. The parking brake broke. 2. Horrible rearward vision. 3. Clumsy HVAC that require me to spin a dorky dial - it's not an auto system and BMW calling it that is a lie. 4. Lousy Harmon Kardon stereo with no MP3 ability and one disc. 5. Lack of torque until the revs are super high. 6. Not nearly enough power. 7. Handling isn't sharp enough. 8. Double-pull to unlock doors. 9. Small side mirrors."

I solved my squeaks and rattle issues but once in a long while, one will mysteriously occur and then just as mysteriously disappear (very random and difficult to locate). 6. Torque steer - It's mild (not excessive as some people believe) but it's there. 7. I have to be careful with my keys in hand and seat belt buckle because the interior aluminum trim does dent easily. 8. On cold morning starts, the engine may idle rough for a couple of minutes. 9. Rear window visibility could be better. 10. Glove box and center console storage compartment could be bigger, and I really miss the center overhead sunglasses compartment like the one in my '00 TL.  Contrary to what most of you believe, I don't think the TL is perfect or the best car in this class. I simply stated that the TL represents the best value, overall.

716,riez,April 2004,- Drop the el cheapo hood prop rod! - Needs to use space-saving multi-link trunk hinges to maximize trunk space. - Needs deeper (numerically lower) overdrive top gear. The 0.85:1 5th is too high. 0.75 would boost highway fuel economy. Or needs 6-speed with this deeper overdrive. - Should have at least optional spilt-fold rear seat. - Steering wheel should have radio controls (only has cruise control). - Manual transmission cars should be available with stability control system. - TRD should offer supercharger accessory. - SportCross (touring) should have available manual transmission.

In any case I think 300HP is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of i's competition. One of the reasons M45 did so poorly is luck of V6. Most of GS, E and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders, in fact 80% of GS is I6. I don't think Acura wants to spend money on something they can't sell, if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build V8.

739,pat,April 2004,"Let's don't and say we did, eh?  :-)  It's lots more interesting to talk about what we like and dislike than what the abstract numbers say, seems to me."
740,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"Overpriced in your eyes - which is all that matters when buying - to me the price was right. A G35 manual at 27k with the features I required (leather, moon, xenons) still wouldnt be acceptable to my wallet because my heart wouldn't have been satisfied.  I've spent the first 28 years of my life being sensible with car purchases - I'd always take the better deal over the vehicle that really stirred my soul. Once I began looking in that over 25k bracket I decided I wouldn't settle for a car that didn't get me excited the moment I saw it.  We're all hardwired differently. My priorities were fun, manual, 4 doors over - price wasn't going to determine the purchase. never again if I can help it. I love cars too much to settle."
741,scott1,April 2004,"I agree with sawyerjon on the performance of the CTS with the new 3.6 liter engine. I traded in a navy blue 99 corvette for my luxury sport package equipped CTS, so I know how a true sports car is supposed to handle. While the CTS obviously doesn't have the horsepower that the corvette does, it handles extremely well...with tight responsive steering and brisk throttle response. The engine has a nice refined purrr to it too.   Before ordering the CTS, I spent a month driving every other competitor I could think of, from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity, even a Lincoln LS. The only one I didn't consider was Honda/Acura. I had a really bad ownership experience with a Honda some years ago..and can't bring myself to buy another.    For what I am looking for in a car at this point in my life, the CTS fit the bill better then anything else. It has room and comfort, very satisfying handling and acceleration, the luxury feel that I think I deserve, and bold styling that sets it apart from the crowd and turns heads on the road.  Scott"
742,chrisboth,April 2004,"PS i dont have the stripper either so i know what you mean. As far as engine prowess you'd need to get the m3 to really have anything over on the G regardless of displacement. As we i believe agree, the zhp and the G sedan stocker is dead even for almost any category. At upper highway speeds the G may have a chance to outshine a tad.  And really price is an issue or we'd all be in maserati or lambo. Price is not an issue for a certain bracket or segment but you are still locked into that segment. I got to save 7 k from the 40k zhp and i can hang with it so i dont feel i compromised within my class...and ZHP is really a class higher imo (between m and 330)."
743,shipo,April 2004,"...so the handling on the CTS has improved, what about the interior and even more so, the exterior? I just couldn't bring a face like that into my garage.  Best Regards, Shipo"
744,bxd20,April 2004,"CTS interior got some mild updates (a little more wood, a little more classy lighting of instruments). Full re-work for 2006 model. Exterior has had minor updates as well (trunk lid dropping that ugly grey and gaining a body color license bezel, better wheels, better onstar antenna style and positioning).  Ultimately, you have to like the styling of the car you're buying if you're a car guy. If you don't, no use trying to force it.  Dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? More power to you.  You eluded to a perf package 330 being $39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a $6k more. I just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a G35 or CTS in fairly basic form. MSRP came to $45k. So that 330 with perf pack is at the VERY least $10k more than a G35 or CTS.  Putting price aside... The 3 series sedan simply isn't big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat, unless they're all of shorter statue. If you're very well off and don't need to carry more than two people around for any serious amount of time and the BMW speaks to your soul, enjoy. I think the rest of us (G35/TL/CTS/LS/9-3) will find wonderful ways to spend our $10k.  Brian"
745,chrisboth,April 2004,Im bigger than most so i find the 3 too small in the front as well - not bad but after a while its not quite as nice as the 5 sized G..and still less dough!
746,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"Dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? More power to you.  When it comes to happiness, yes. In the scheme of things if I keep the car for 3 years and paid it off, that'd be 2k a year. I'm not going to be unhappy for 2k a year. As I'm leasing it (for less than a comparable time/mileage lease of a 30k G35), I'm really paying maybe 200-300 extra a year. Is your auto bliss worth $50 a month? $2 a day? Mine is.  You eluded to a perf package 330 being $39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a $6k more. I just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a G35 or CTS in fairly basic form. MSRP came to $45k.  MSRP on my 330i with perf, metallic paint, xenon, leather and sunroof was 43k. I paid 39k for it in May of 2003.  So that 330 with perf pack is at the VERY least $10k more than a G35 or CTS.  Yeah I had negotiated a G35 down to 30k with the stuff I wanted. Still I wasn't overwhelmed by the G.  Putting price aside... The 3 series sedan simply isn't big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat, unless they're all of shorter statue.  A. Not my problem as I'm in the driver's seat. B. If they don't like it, they can take a different car. C. Most of my female friends are shorter than five-five. D. I don't know 3 other males I'd drive anywhere with for five minutes, let alone to Vegas (300 miles).  I think the rest of us (G35/TL/CTS/LS/9-3) will find wonderful ways to spend our $10k.  That's my response to people who brag they paid cash for a car - 30-40k. I'd rather drop that as a downpayment on a house, rent the place, get 20% ROI a year and a fat tax write off.  We all value things differently. The car to me will disappear, the happiness will be a great memory and we can always make more money."
747,blueguydotcom,April 2004,I love the concept of a hardtop convertible sport sedan. Not sold on the look - but that's useless compared to the fun - of the IS replacement. V8 power also troubles me...  Still it's an intriguing concept.

The first time I saw one..I loved it, so you know what camp I'm in on that issue. :>     I just put a coat of Meguiars new nxt generation tech wax on it this morning, and man does that dark blue metallic paint shine on there. With the mirror finished alloy wheels setting it off, The CTS is one fine looking car. I find myself looking back at it in parking lots a lot as I walk away....and it DOES turn heads on the road .    I need the car I drive to look rich and distinctive, to be somthing that is not mistaken for a dozen other similiar cars. The CTS does that in spades."
751,mariner7,April 2004,"The claring weakness of TL is 100-0 braking. Downright ridiculous and dangerous compared to the others! There should be no excuse for it at all.  I drive previous gen TL regularly. Now that I know, I will be extra careful in hi speed driving."

754,riez,April 2004,"Check out the May 2004 issue of C&D, page 132. Their ""Short Take"" on the TL A-Spec. They tested a 6-speed manual. MSRP as-tested was $40,895 (over base of $38,895.

(Braking performance was actually worse.)  One big problem remains: torque steer!  ""What the A-Spec package does not address, however, is the biggest flaw of a TL with a manual transmission, and that's torque steer.

Appears that unlike BMW and its successful performance-enhancing 330i Perf Pkg (ZHP), Acura followed same mistakes Lexus did with its failed IS300 L-tuned and SportDesign programs. Huge chunk of money for styling mods!"

757,scott1,April 2004,"Good point about the Aztek..but that one turns heads because its uncommonly ugly, not so the CTS. At the price point of the cars were discussing, we're not buying them just for basic transportation...a 10 thousand dollar Kia will get you from point A to point B. The participants in this forum are looking for something more from their car. We want that trip from point a to point b to be enjoyable.    Styling will always be a personal preference, heck, the new BMW look has drawn very mixed reactions. Car stylists have to be more then just ""safe"", they need some originality, something in their designs that show that they can do something more then just copy whats already been done. If not, the roads will be filled with unassuming vehicles that may be pleasent, but sure not exciting."
758,qbrozen,April 2004,"I'm obviously missing something because when they first tested the TL, they pulled a .81g on the skidpad. So now its getting .9 with the add-on package?

The former has none of it while the latter still does.  A bit like deciding whether to worry upon entering a building that was labelled largely devoid of anthrax.  As C&D and others have written, the torque steer issue is most problematic with MANUAL TRANSMISSON TLs. By its very nature, the slushbox works to amelieorate much, though not all, of the inherent torque steer."
762,blueguydotcom,April 2004,"Does you ZHP have a staggered setup? I've been told that staggered tire sizes increase tramlining. While I can't say for sure if this is true or not, I do notice that my staggered 8-month setup (245/40r and 225/45f) tramlines MUCH worse than my non-staggered winter setup (225/45's on all corners). Other factors that may play into this are; softer sidewalls on winter package, different tread patterns/materials, that extra inch of tread width on the rears during the summer may be just enough to catch more edges in the road... maybe a combination of them or maybe none at all.  They are staggered, so that may play a role in it."

764,raher,April 2004,"Most of what ends up getting posted these days is the same subjects and opinions that were being discussed a month ago...torque steer, my car is faster than your car, handles better, is prettier, etc etc etc I took a five hour road trip to Eastern Washington and back to play golf today and to just drive my TL. Great road to drive leading up to a mountain pass and through a gorgeous canyon with a river running next to the road. The TL is such a nice road car. I wasn't throwing it around as some do mostly because the road is notorious for state police and sure enough they were out at 7:00 AM when I was driving over. Sun was up at 7:00 and I drove home in 80 degree temperatures. I really got a dose of what a near luxury sport sedan is about. The car is extremely comfortable, great sound system, fun to drive fast when you can and I got 30 miles per gallon coming home because there was enough traffic you couldn't really drive fast. I didn't feel any torque steer and I was doing 80 through some of the corners going over in the morning. There surely are some differences in the cars being discussed here but the numbers are so small as to be almost inconsequential in most cases (.89 versus .90 skidpad..5.6 versus 5.8 0-60) I believe the kind of driving I did today is the true measure of a near luxury sport sedan because I think it represents the kind of driving that 99% of the people who own these cars actually do. I am sure that my trip would have been just as enjoyable in a 330I or a G or an IS 300. I just happen to own a TL and today I was really pleased that I do."

My definition of ""Torque Steer"" is when the driven front wheels take steering matters into their own hands when power is applied, especially during a turn or when the road surface is sloped.  When I described the phenomena on I-80, which is (relatively) smooth asphalt and has two ruts, one for the left tire and one for the right, I was referring to Torque Steer, at least according to my definition.  Best Regards, Shipo"
771,speedracer3,April 2004,"Definition: The annoying tendency of some front-wheel drive vehicles to pull to one side when engine torque is applied. In other words, you step on the gas and the car wants to steer right or left. By redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels, the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced. The other cure is to keep off the gas"

Great engine and steering. Things I didn't like: - Interior is only fair after having an Audi - Steering - I drove about 70 mph around a sweeping freeway interchange ramp. There's a spot where the pavement changes and there's a 1/2-1 inch elevation difference. When I hit it in the G35 the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hand - THAT'S the sort of real-world handling I DON'T like! I tried the same spot and speed later in my A4 and there was virtually no 'kick' in the steering wheel. In conclusion, the interior and this steering behavior were enough to rule out the G35 for me.

781,glenford,April 2004,"Finally got to drive a G35x today (nearest dealer is 50+ miles away) on my way to the NY auto show. Looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi - I drove both of those a month ago (that dealer only 45 miles away - in a different direction).  My needs list - AWD, highly reliable, ""compact"" size, fun to drive, and it falls off after that. Price is a consideration.  My observations: AWD performance - I'll never know from a test drive not in nasty snow - assume they are both good.  Price - G35x, by a couple thousand or more, depending on if I compare to 325 or 330.  Reliability - varies by the individual car, of course, but Infiniti looks to have (significantly?) better odds  Size - comparable, but the BMW seemed a little cramped to me (the oft-repeated comments about the ""grade"" of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me - both are fine)  Fun - This is a little harder, since the lag between my drive times was long, but here's how it felt, and I'm looking for your observations:  There is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2. Maybe daily it doesn't matter, but it's easy to feel. Otherwise, the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the g35. G35 might ride better, but I also felt that it was a little over-sensitive to minor inputs, and I didn't feel that in the BMW. They all braked strongly (as much as I can test in a test drive).  I'm not looking to restart the ""I love my xxx, it's the best"" wars, but I would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both (or all 3). All are seemingly very nice - even near-luxury (!) cars.  Interesting cars from the show (in their AWD versions, which sometimes means coming soon) - Lexus 2005 GS, Saab 9-2 (even if it is a Subaru ;-), Acura RL (but too big for me). Acura said all their cars would be AWD if I wanted to wait. Infinity M (again too big, though). It was crowded down there today, bad weather or not."
782,rderizans,April 2004,"I had a '99 328i for just over five years and purchased a G35x back in January. I test drove the 325ix and 330ix as well as the A4 1.8T and 3.0. My opinions were similar to yours:  - BMW engines are the smoothest out there and my 328i was the smoothest of any car I've ever driven (I think they get better with age). If the ABS system hadn't gone (~$3000 estimated to repair), I'd still be driving it for sure. The G35 engine is great and VERY powerful, but somehow not as much fun to rev to the redline as the BMW engines. - 325 and Audi engines just didn't have enough torque for me. The Audi felt nice, but the throttle response wasn't there for me. - G35 is bigger than the other cars. Significantly in overall size, somewhat less significantly in interior room but still, it's a bigger car with more room, which was a positive for me. - Handling was similar in all - excellent.  As you can see, I like all of the cars. In the end, the decision for me came down to value and reliability. The G35x simply is a great value when compared to the BMWs and Audis. Sure, the interior plastics aren't quite up to snuff, but the leather is nicer (in my opinion), it's the most powerful in the group, and your reliability odds are definitely better with Inifiniti.  No matter which you choose, you'll love the car. It's a great choice to have!"
783,jrock65,April 2004,"I agree w/ rderizans that the leather in the G is nicer. But I prefer softer leathers.  The biggest weakness of the G is grade of interior materials (other than seats), but if you're not bothered by them, the G35x should be a top candidate. Seeing that the power difference (or lack thereof) in the 325ix was noticeable to you, I'd recommend not getting it. Might nag you constantly. The 330ix is a fine machine, you can't go wrong with it either."

I must admit before I test drove the 325ci(w/sport)I expected the car to be a dog and much to my surprise it was reasonably fast. The 330i(w/sport) was a wonderful car to drive. It was smooth and felt like it took far less effort to pick up speed. I have nothing negative to say about how the 330i drives. I just think the look is a little dated to me and the 3 series around here are far too common.  When my G35coupe was in for service I was given a G35X( I happened to get caught in the middle of an unexpected snow storm. It handled very well. I never had any problems the entire day. Now, it was not on the same level as my wife's A6 quattro but the car handling capabilities are more than adequate. I prefer the interior of the 3 series but I agree with some others on this board with regard to the seats. The seats are more comfortable in the G."

788,lxgmb,April 2004,"I am in north jersey. Let me tell you my recent experience with the dealer loaner. My 2001 car has 38K miles on it. When you make regular service appointment, they put you at least 3 weeks later, and give you a 2004 loaner.  1. In March, something was wrong on the car, I called, they scheduled it 3 weeks later. I asked, if they can make it earlier, because I was not sure if the problem was critical or not. They said, they can, but they don't have loaner, I have to rent a car at my own expense.  2. 10 days ago, my car was hit by a lost-control car, some bodyworks need to be done, I have to rent a car myself. ( I don't blame them for this one.)  3. This moring, my car stopped on highway ( see my previous post). The malfunction fuel gauge showed that I have half tank of gas, actually the tank is empty. When I call the dealer, they said they can treat it as urgent service, but, again, I have to rent a car at my own expense, because they don't have loaner.  You CAN get a loaner, if you schedule the service several weeks earlier. If it is anything urgent comes up, sorry, you have to rent a car yourself.  The problems are: 1. They want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners, 2. The MB cars have too many problems, people are busy bringing in their cars to get fixed.  I hope I haven't bought this car!  I am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires. I just can't afford the time, the money and the patience. I just can't!  Finally, a funny thing, when I was at the dealer several days ago, I overheard a lady who drives a coupe complained a problem, I told her I have had that problems about 10 times. She said, that's no big deal, she still have had A problem, B problem, C problems,...."

I am really considering the G coupe as a 3rd car and have found 6 '03 G coupes @ several Carmax locations on the east coast. Five of them are automatics & one is manual; however, the one manual has basically every option (including the overpriced nav) and they want $34K for it. The autos have the prem package and are stickering for 30-31K. I have always owned manuals, but I have been strongly considering going the auto route for traffic's sake. Did you test drove both? Does the automatic feel like it is giving anything up to the stick? Thanks for your opinions!  Anyone else owning the G coupe feel free to fill me in.THANKS!"

In my experiences the manual version will always give you a closer connection between the driver and their car (as blueguydotcom stated) but I disagree with his statement about the auto G35coupe. The manumatic is better than what you will find offered on most vehicles in a similar price range."
796,sweetc230,April 2004,"That was pretty straight forward. That much of a difference, huh?. . .that is kind of a bummer, but I guess that is why I have only owned manuals.  Anyone else who has test driven or owns one, do you feel the same as blueguy?"

If it's your 3rd car (as in you have 3 at once, not sequentially) maybe you can stick with the stick. But since you mention traffic....  My wife and I ALWAYS owned manuals, until the day I broke tibia/fibula playing soccer. Switched one to auto then, and as traffic built up and commute got worse, switched the other car. Drove a loaner stick recently, and it was just great fun, but probably won't go back."

804,chrisboth,April 2004,A 10 year warranty has all but eliminated past concerns from the original excel era. The warranty's are nearly costless according to insiders as there is no tranferability and most people wont keep the car for more than 4 years. Thier repuation is much improved and with US and japanse investements in Huyundia they will only get better. They weren't around in 1980 here in US and are now 3rd largerst carmaker I believe and sell more than Chrysler here at home.
805,fjm1,April 2004,My .02: Aggressive TQM coupled with very low total costs of operation spell success for Hyundai.

They still have a ways to go before they catch up with the big 3 Japanese manufacturers. My biggest beef with Hyundai is that their designs are derivative and not very original.

810,saugatak,April 2004,"S. Korea's credit ratings had little to do with N. Korea. Their problem was that they tied up too much capital in unproductive conglomerates whose ROI was awful because they were not run by real businessmen, but well connected people who were able to obtain interest free government loans and guarantees, which basically encouraged rampant overexpansion and covered up their mistakes.  For example, the South Korean domestic car industry is large enough to support only 1, maybe 2 domestic manufacturers. Instead, S. Korea had Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo and for a brief time, Samsung.  It is insane that Korea had 4 major manufacturers when Germany can support only 2 and the U.S. had 3 (until recently).  Now that Hyundai is the only major car manufacturer in Korea and doesn't have to worry about insane competition in its home market, they can focus on building better product.  Personally, I can't see Hyundai entering the luxury market until they can compete on a level playing field with Toyota, Honda and Nissan in terms of quality and reputation. When the big 3 of Japan made their move into luxury, what made it possible was the fact that they had cemented their reputations as building solid, reliable cars. Until Hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, I can't see people associating Hyundai with that luxury brand image.  OTOH, if Hyundai keeps up the good work, it won't necessarily take long. Look how fast Ghosn turned around Nissan/Infinit."
811,kahunah,April 2004,"""Until Hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, I can't see people associating Hyundai with that luxury brand image.""  Back in 1986, Honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate Honda with a luxury brand image. Yet, they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brand...Acura. Five years later in 1991, the Legend Coupe won Motor Trend's prestigious Import Car of the Year trophy. The same year, the Integra took the laurels as one of Car & Driver's Ten Best. The Integra would continue to make the Ten Best list in four of the next ten years. The Legend Coupe won the title twice.  Kinda makes you think, don't it?"
812,saugatak,April 2004,"Not disagreeing with any of your points. If Hyundai makes a great car at a great price, yes perhaps they could compete.  But there are several factors working against that.  First, the competition now is much more intense than ever before. Cadillac is producing nice cars, Chrysler is coming out with interesting product, the [non-permissible content removed]. big 3 are in the game now, and though MB and BMW have stumbled, they're still major players.  What worked back then won't necessarily work now.  Second, I don't know Hyundai's cash situation, but I don't think it's as good as Honda or Toyota when they launched their luxury brands.  In any case, I don't think Hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury.  Hopefully Hyundai will follow the path of the Japanese. More quality cars, choices and competition can only benefit consumers.  What will be interesting is what happens when the Chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market."

818,buddhabman,April 2004,"Subaru with the new Legacy is on the cusp of Premium / Near Luxury right now. We are only waiting for the ""Official"" pronouncements from the media to validate this. This is not even considering the Premium Subaru 7 Pass that is in the works.  Now to true Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans  Here is the Hirsch Aero Stuff  http://www.saab-performance.com/  SAAB 9-5 AERO TAKES OFF WITH A HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE  Already known for its responsive performance, contemporary design and world-class safety, the sporty Saab 9-5 Aero gets a bit more extreme with the introduction of the Saab Performance by Hirsch enhancement package.  Saab's Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero gives the growing number of enthusiast customers a chance to express their individuality with significant engine and chassis upgrades and sporty styling treatments for the interior and exterior. Customers can mix and match options, as desired.  The Saab Performance by Hirsch package upgrades the Trionic engine control module, turbocharger, intercooler and intake pipes to provide a 22 percent horsepower boost to the Saab 9-5 Aero's 2.3-liter turbo engine - from 250 to 305 hp. The torque also rises, from 258 to 309 lbs.-ft. These numbers would provide the Saab 9-5 Aero with 133 horsepower per liter of displacement - a feat unmatched not only by other luxury sports sedans and wagons, but also unmatched by most sports cars.  Other enhancements include a full sports exhaust system, including dual tailpipes, performance brakes, a lowered chassis with sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels.  Bystanders will know something other than the standard 9-5 Aero passed them when they see the sports mesh grille insert, front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler and unique contoured rear bumper that come with the Hirsch package. Plus, the 9-5 SportWagon gets a spoiler on the rear bridge, while the sedan gets a trunk-mounted lip spoiler.  Inside, the Hirsch package offers sports leather trim for the seats and door inserts, brushed aluminum door handles, aluminum pedals, sport steering wheel and a unique finish for the main fascia, including the information and audio displays.  The Saab Performance by Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero is the result of the long-term agreement between Saab Automobile AB and Hirsch Performance AG, the Swiss company with extensive experience in customizing Saab cars.  Saab Performance by Hirsch products are fully guaranteed by Saab and Hirsch.  HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE FOR THE SAAB 9-5: Upgrades of Trionic ECM, turbocharger, intercooler, intake pipe Horsepower boosted to 305 bhp max Torque increased to 309 lbs.-ft. Sports exhaust with dual pipes Performance brakes Lowered chassis with sports-tuned suspension 18-inch alloy wheels Sports mesh grille insert New front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler Contoured rear bumper assembly with sculpted side sill extensions Roof-mounted rear bridge spoiler (wagon) or trunk-mounted lip spoiler (sedan) Sports leather interior, including seats and door inserts New interior fascia finish, including information and audio display Brushed aluminum interior door handles Aluminum pedals Sports steering wheel  Lobbying to persuade Saab to sell this kit in the US.

819,saugatak,April 2004,"Kicking the old RL is a cheapshot . . . nobody defends the old RL, but the new RL looks pretty nice and if it's SH-AWD works as advertised, with the 300 HP v6 (best in class aside from insanely priced M3 and M5), I think the new RL will do pretty well and probably raise the prestige of the Acura brand.  Until Acura incorporates SH-AWD into their entire lineup, they're going to be considered a tweener brand b/c, like it or not, luxury is now associated with RWD or AWD. Some claim a v8 is necessary for lux as well, but I don't agree with that because very few people elect v8s for their sedans, even when available. I would, however, like to see Acura incorporate a V8 (or IMA or other torque boosting tech.) in their SUVs which are in serious need of a low end torque boost  However, there's nothing wrong with tweener luxury brands. I think it's great that you can get a TL or G35 for approx. $20k less than the equivalent BMW or MB (I'm comparing 5 and C class here, not 3 series b/c it's just too small).  I know there are fans of Acura and Infiniti who are annoyed with the MB/BMW/Lexus snobbery, but honestly, is it really a good thing for the consumer if both Acura and Infiniti climb up the prestige ladder a la Lexus? What do I get out of that? The right to pay more for the same car? The feeling of superiority from the badge?  Frankly, I'm hoping that Acura and Infiniti continue to produce quality vehicles yet remain tweener brands.  If you race me in my TL or G35 (narrowed down my choice to these 2) in your Lexus/BMW/MB and I lose, it's because my wallet is so much heavier than yours."

But the point that came through at the end is true: All the cars in this segment are very good at doing what they're made to do and selecting between them reflects more on the priorities of the buyer than the superiority of one car versus another. The TL is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with $30-40 K to spend on a performance sedan than the others. Yes, a big part of that is subjective (new model/styling, buzz from good reviews) but when you take a bunch of cars that all perform great, its the subjective stuff that makes the difference.  I bought the TL because it performs great, I never had a problem with torque steer (for the information of those overly attached to RWD) and in the end the styling and technology (love the bluetooth) were better than the rest. Especially for the $.  You guys pick what you like, the world be damned but everyone else is buying what they like, and a lot of us like the TL best."

Of course, we'll have to see if BMW pushes xdrive downstream to the 3-series and gets rid of their current AWD setup.  I think a lot of people are waiting (including myself), not for the redesign of the exterior/interior, which I like on all models, but the bump-up of HP/torque under the hood.  BMW needs to go back to basics, which are all around competent vehicles with class leading HP, and a dash of Valvetronic technology thrown in for good measure. I can take or leave idrive for example, but they have to be more than the ""underpowered"" gold standard."
848,darnac,May 2004,"Not to take this too off topic but since we are discussing the audio sytstems in comparable vehicles stereo (2 channel) is and probably will always be the audiophile's choice. Music reproduction is not about being in the center of it. Having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music. I dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit. Music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source. When you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you. There are no speakers at the rear. Room dynamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided. 5.1 is what Hollywood uses and for that purpose (movies) it probably is best. Top Gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 5.1, 5.2 or what are they now talking about 6.2 with a speaker overhead or something. It is a fact that DVD-A sounds much better than CD so from that standpoint the Acura has a big advantage. We may see some manufacture going for the better still SACD but I have not heard anything yet. If any of you are ever in Las Vegas in January they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention. They have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of $100,000. 95% of the rooms are 2-channel stereo and most of those rooms use analogue (records) not digital sources."
849,jrock65,May 2004,"BMW sold 4400 5 series last month, and MB sold 5000 E-class. Pretty good for both companies. But you gotta remember that buyers in this segment are pretty much limited to these two cars right now, with the GS, A6, RL, M, and STS in their last model year. The story will change once these cars come out at almost the same time, and all of them seem much improved from the previous version.  I still expect the E and the 5 to be the sales leaders, but the other cars will undoubtely take quite a bit of sales away."

856,nyrefugee,May 2004,"I have to say the pricing info you are giving is misleading. First you are comparing it with a coupe G35 and everybody knows that the coupes are (i) priced higher (ii) considered more rare and thus unlikely to get any discounts. Since the acura is a sedan, you should compare with the g35 sedan. On top of everything you are comparing with the g35 manual transmission coupe which is the rarest and highest performing g35 version. It is harder to get discounts on that car ... usually each dealership only has one of them and is not worried about being able to sell it.  Also you obviously preferred the accura which means you did not bargin for a better price for the infiniti.  If you compare a G35 sedan with a TL sedan the bargained for prices should be about the same.  I would still recomend the TL for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance and the TL does seem to have a couple of more features, such as voice recognition on the navigation, bluetooth, etc."

I'm not sure I'll get what I want, ever again... So, I got her car the way I would have wanted it.. Sport package (she could care less, but does like the seats), HK stereo (she never cranks it), Xenons... I also bought M68s off a 330i, so I could keep the winter tires on her stock style 96s.

The bar just keeps getting higher....  10 years ago the only sedan that could run like my G35 had an M on the tail. Now we've got TL, IS, 3ers going like stink. And the M's, AMGs, and the new Maserati are light years beyond that. It's a great time to be an enthusiast.  Hope gas prices don't put the kaibosh on it. My car get terrible mileage."
873,lexusguy,May 2004,"I dont think rising gas prices is going to have a major impact. Look at the CL and SL65 AMG. Most powerful production M-Bs ever, they make a 400hp M5 look like your Grandma's Buick Century. Then there's the Buggatti, the Bentley GT, Maserati MC12, etc. Its funny to think that cars like the Charger, Cuda, 442, etc could be embarrased by today's Acura TLs.  Now all I need is a hybrid SH-AWD Acura RL pushing 350-400hp. Toyota and Honda's technology has the potential to majorly shake up the performance industry, I think. There's rumors of an AWD Lexus GS350GT with 470hp getting 40mpg. Now THAT is having one's cake and eating it too."
874,blueguydotcom,May 2004,Hope gas prices don't put the kaibosh on it. My car get terrible mileage.  Huh? I just drove to Vegas this week in my Bimmer. Running an average of 90 (but more realistically over 90 as I had to fight traffic to get out of San Diego at 5pm) I got 26 mpg. That was including one segment of about 70 miles at over 100 mph and occasional bursts to over 120. 26 mpg isn't too shabby.  Coming home as it was day and traffic was thicker I still averaged 80 and got 30 mpg.  I couldn't do that with my econobox commuter.

It is a super high performance 2? seater vehicle, costing many more bucks than an M5, without the option of a stick shift.

880,chrisboth,May 2004,I wont try and convince you but i wont let other G owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.  MOST mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to A/F ratio increases. If I put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my A/F ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car. If you suggest that I can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream. If you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free. It contains the O2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol). The more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a FIXED amount of fuel.  I have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way. If the A/F ratio is 10 to 1 stock and I put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage. Most people driving modded G's are there reporting 25-29. Most stock ones are 17-23. Not scientific study but not it's rocket science either.
881,chrisboth,May 2004,"""There's a weird thing going in the above sentences. You never had a bad experience with VW service, yet your car was in the shop 18 times in a year? That to me signals what my two year ownership of VW confirmed - it's an incompetent company.""  It is some weird stuff I'm saying but you're correct..the manufacturer is losing it and they are in disarray. The phaeton is dead on arrival, the beetle is about had it's run - what are they going to make it look like now?, the passat was a great car except for the demons that live in the electrical system and it's about a year past it's sylish life and what was that 40k W-8 POS motor that's slower than a VQ all about? Luxury brand remaking is good if your customers dont stress about getting it home very night.  In light of all this the dealer was great and the service guys were very nice and gave me loaner cars when they didn't have to and were professional, timeley and very courteous but I wish I didn't have to find out they were nice. They made the most of thier opportunity to correct the uncorrectable. Jim Wynn in Norristown PA by the way. In the words of the guy who handed me a check for all my money back less 200 bucks for mileage, ""Once they get a bug you can't kill it"". He said the 7 series is the biggest electrical nightmare in germany right now as all the cool electrical modules and miles of fiber optics and 30 way headrests make it fail at almost 2% rate.  Never german is my motto even as I represent my friends and family at the audi dealer in thier purchases...yes i love to negotiate and i buy cars for fun and free for them (thier money of course). And I still give the passat thumbs up for being the best family sedan out there for the $ - as long as you get a good one...quite a caveat but I'm surprise when I tell people about my expereince how they still want the passat...great car for them...wonder what will save them now?"
882,kdshapiro,May 2004,"""I wont try and convince you but i wont let other G owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.""  Huh? Since when does manufacturers that provide mods the G have the lock and key on plenum upgrades. Breathing easier implies more gas, not more efficiency. There is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency.  But we are way off topic here and talking about misinformation, I would like an Infiniti dealer to come on by to this forum and say there is no warranty issue, and that mods such as yours increase performance, average gas mileage, efficiency and reliability as you claim. For that Infiniti dealer will be getting my business next, no questions asked."
883,chrisboth,May 2004,"G35driver.com You can be schooled all your willing...  ""Since when does manufacturers that provide mods the G have the lock and key on plenum upgrades. Breathing easier implies more gas, not more efficiency. There is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency.""  Lock and key on what? If you can weld you can do this but theres no point on a BMW - the plenum is not sloped in the front! Hell the plenum design is completely different on a straigh six. You can add a hood scoop ram air deal like my dads duster had - go for it. Only this car [G] as I am aware would benefit from a plenum change. Most cars already have a level plenum! So i guess we do have a lock and key...  The throttle body is fine and so is the cylinder size and design...what are you talking about. Those things work well even with a choking plenum!  No infiniti dealer will ever condone aftermarket mods. They usually are too ignorant to understand that they have to fix the car unless they can prove the mod created the problem ...You want the answer? Speak to my lemon attorney who deals in warranty cases on the side. You have more rights than you give yourself credit for.  The consumer shouldn't be held down by the ignorant whims of a unknowledgable service rep or tech or dealers. The ones I talk to will say hey great mod but not in front of thier anti-mod manager. Obviously if a dealer comes out and says mod all you want, he'll be dealing with idoits who botch thier installs and act like nothing was even touched by them let alone modded....  It's cut and dry in form but dealers will try and manhandle you. AS with most others that try to screw me out of my money they will lose. If you do want to talk to a dealer who is mod ornery Grubbs Infiniti acctually builds race cars and test cars and offer a full service tuner shop where you can buy NISMO and a host of aftermarket products intalled by them. Don't be fooled by the never been there's. My dealer never saw mods until I and subsequently a few others brought in modded G's last year. They have been educated and will continue to be as long as the trend for getting that easily obtained 300 hp is around.  I used to be skeptical too. When I asked these questions the anwers were there for the plucking. The anti mod attitude takes a while to get over and then you see the light. Maybe you should buy an infiniti now that you know all this great stuff!"
884,kdshapiro,May 2004,"NISMO is sponsored and supported by Nissan, just like in Europe some supercharged induction systems are supported and installed by BMW.  Again, I am not saying these mods don't do something, but I do not believe the Infiniti engineers were too stupid or ignorant to miss obvious design points that would weaken an otherwise great car - when a third party shop comes in with a fix for $500 that will increase, performance, reliability and gas mileage. That's what you've been implying/saying and I'm contesting."
885,speedracer3,May 2004,"Chris,  I won't go into horrible detail, but be warned that NMAC is a absolute nightmare to deal with if you have a problem. I still think some of Nissan/Infinti cars out there are very good, but from my dealings with them after my last Maxima lease, they have lost me for good. Love the product, hate the company."
886,chrisboth,May 2004,"Sounds like a nightmare speedracer. Dealing with corporate morons in VW was in my mind so difficult as it infuriates people to no end and they just go away and buy another car. Your case may be different but when you actually have a leg to stand on such as a lemon law.. and an attorney - things start to get way easier in my experience.  I actaully told VWOA i simply wanted a warranty that would keep me happy in the car after the 2/24000 was up and free from unlimitied repair costs for a young car. They laughed and told me flat out no...they want you to go away and or get an attorney - they dont want to deal with an unhappy consumer. The frim I used has pre-litigation programs with VW where they settle 20 cars at a time....but they cant give me an extended warranty. It never even occurred to me to sue them until she laughed at me! I had a such a good set of fact in my favor the attorney i hired told me in 15 minutes I would win and the next I heard VWOA was back on the phone asking how i would like the buy back guy to obtain my car in exchange for a check.  To the point that the designers are stupid: Look all the G had to have was enough HP to dethrone a couple of stlawart sedans from the top of the hill. If it gets better HP or equal for that matter to the class contenders, what's the problem. I would bet that 3.0 in your car has some more power stashed in there..it's a function of exterior design in the Z /G case...money is probably a bigger one. Hell we could put forged internals in all the cars and bigger cams...at some point the marketers take over and say lets build the car with x horsepower and y looks and z price. If it sells then the slanted plenum is not such a big deal...except to those of us who want the power and dont have the slanted hood of the Z. Turn out it fits in the Z too if you take out the hood liner!  No engine sold today has all the perfect design attributes...they are all filled with trade offs unless you get exotic. This trade off was a sloped hood for 20 HP. And it's a good move obviously since they sell Z's like candy and the engine does pretty well gettting them 1320 feet in 13.5 stock. Thats carerra territory almost so while you wonder about that others were saying hey - we can do better and they do. This seem like voo doo to you the way it used to to me! It's ok KD - deep breath...."
887,speedracer3,May 2004,"Getting back to the point. The VQ is a very tunable engine, it is no wonder that Nissan literally uses it in nearly its entire product line. Nissan has varied the HP rating by applying minor tweaks to the engine or exhaust system. You are living proof that getting more juice out of the VQ can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well. As we discussed, the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong. Solution is either have 1)A good dealer 2) A good mechanic.  As to your rant about why companies don't give you the maximum potential in your engine, go figure. My Audi 1.8T with the right chip program can generate 200hp. Why do they give a measly 170hp?..my thought, so they don't trounce their V6s."
888,chrisboth,May 2004,the audi can actually get a 70hp increase from a chip i hear. High boost has it's own set of risks tho...and that risk everyone keeps talking about is more like the risk (for my minor mods anyway) that the owner wont have the fortitude to actually get something they deserve and will cave...the law is the law

905,kennyg5,June 2004,"$600 a year? That is not even enough to pay for liability coverage alone, and I have been driving 25 years with a perfect record. LOL. It shows you what New Yorkers have to pay. I pay a lot more for my 03 Max than my 97 Max. Probably due to higher HP and HID theft concerns.  I believe one can get a decent price (ie not MSRP) on a G35 these days. Has anyone compared a similarly equipped G35 against the TL? Which is better priced (not from dealer's perspective)?"
906,gpwatfrd,June 2004,I can only speak to personal experience. The G35coupe was even cheaper to insure than the 02 ES330 which happens to be with AAA NJ. I would have never thought that. This was an 03 330i which I had a deposit on at the time. I thought the BMW quote was high but now outrageous. The real surprise was how cheap the G35coupe was to insure.
907,drmp,June 2004,"The C class deserves consideration especially with the interior and mechanical redesign. I am more interested with the c230 sport sedan with very good fuel economy and a BMW-like performance, excellent oversized 4-piston brembo brakes, staggered 17"" wheels, without sacrificing luxury ride, and excellent noise control.  The C320 has a much smoother & heavier engine but it takes away the fun factor and the tossability of the car. Hey, you only live once, you might as well enjoy it."

909,pmb,June 2004,"I traded in my 2001 330ci for a 2004 g35 cpe about 4 months ago. I will admit that the g35 exhaust sounds powerful and it is probably quicker off the line than the 330, but the 330 is actually quicker 0-60. Also the 330 is a quieter car on the road...I tend to hear more road noise in the g35. As far as gas mileage i now get about 20% worse mileage than my bmw. I do have to admit though that the g35 seats are very comfortable. Bottom line is that there is a difference, but the g35 is also 10 less than a similar 330ci."
910,chrisboth,June 2004,I can personally attest and sill readily assure you that the BMW is not faster 0-60 unless in Perf Package. If you buy an auto the difference between the two auto's is about .8 or so difference. All 3 series fall short or barely match (perf only) the G 1/4 mile time. The G is more visceral and with more engine noise the ride is louder - but with 220 watts of bose you wont care unless you are like me and you like th noise. I haven't put in a CD in 3 months and barely turn it on. With 277 or whatever HP the G will run about 14.1 in the quarter my guess. That's unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a M3.

Is your car an auto?  That's unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a M3.  Your prices are interesting. Wrong but interesting. 58 msrp on the 545i and 47k on the M3.

913,chrisboth,June 2004,"""Buying an automatic in a sports sedan - it's like forcing Jessica Alba to wear a sackcloth all the time. Is your car an auto? ""  Yes it is I dont want to hear it. There are few autos that are this fast when compared to 6sp counterparts. I drive it everyday and dont want fat left leg sydnrome from driving in philly traffic. If i wanted a true sports car with tru sports tranny for tru sports driving (on the weekend) I would look into the miata or the 2 series coming soon. A 5 series size family cruiser with 4 doors is not lacking in 5at form especially at the track where I have done quite well. I owned a 5 speed for 12 years or so - I know all about feeling connected....I dont miss it one bit and since it doesn't slow the car down too much it's prob best left to the new buyer to decide.  In 6MT form the G 1/4 miles are sub 14. Show me a quarter less than 14.5 for any 3 series and I'll make more sense of the comment ""For having 50+ hp on the 3 series the G35 coupe is probably only *marginally* faster in the 1/4 mile. ""  Marginally faster is still faster. 14.6 or 14.5 vs 13.9 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a G is over a 3. Lets see marginally (+) faster and cheaper in any tranny...And don't forget if there are doubters these numbers I qoute are with 260hp. with 270 or more those margins will not get anything but bigger.  .4 seconds is a whooping at the track as the coupes i run can attest.  AS for 545 being sub 60 HA are you kidding. A loaded new 530 is 54-56k as I've shopped them and there are no discounts for a 545. The old 540 loaded was near 68 or so.  M3 for 47K - Stripped maybe and with a discount I can't get !! The 330 loaded is 44 man for 3 more K we'd all be in M3 me included. If you can get these prices please email me as I am the family car shopper and there is a demand at these numbers."

But if you want a BMW you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! Your ride, you decide.  If you're really talking about racing then you can supercharge your M3 and do 0-100 in 5 seconds.  If you want a stripper M3, just order it, you'll wait a few months, but you'll get the car you want.

915,riez,June 2004,"For manual transmission cars, driver skill and familiarity with the clutch & shifter will make a huge difference. The car mag guys are paid to do this and use aggressive means. Are you willing to turn your TC system off and drop your clutch at 3-5,000 RPMs and smoke your tires? Few real world drivers even come close on the street. And if they do it, they don't do it many times.  Even BMW's SMG launch control will only allow so many of the most brutal launches. Forget if the number is 5-6-7.  An automatic transmission takes most of the driver skill out of it. It is easier for the average person to get close to theoretical maximum performance since there are fewer variables and less driving skill is needed.  Don't forget that gearing and final drive ratios are critical. A huge key to best 0-60 mph time is to do it needing only 2 gears (1st and 2nd). Time between shifts is wasted. Too many cars require a shift to 3rd to hit 60 mph. They'll hit the rev limiter before reaching 60 mph and you have to upshift.  C&D's 5-60 mph ""street start"" time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver!"
916,chrisboth,June 2004,"It's been too long so here goes...  ""Yes, I agree if you want a G. But if you want a BMW you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! Your ride, you decide.""  1) Substantially better Gas mileage:  OK you win. Folks do report 3-6 better in a 3 over G. Got to have fuel to beat the class to tears.  2) More refined ride:  NO Is this more interior stuff because in stock 27k form the G handles better is faster than and out tractions (new term) the 330 and matches the 330 zhp. The latest test has the G sedan with 215s at .9 skidpad and most slaloms stats have the G at >66 or so and never once second to a 330 in direct comparison. There is nothing the 3 does better except maybe in ride quality? Where o where is the refinement in a vehicle that is second to the leader in all performance categories. I must have missed that when I bolted for the infiniti dealer after my 330 was 44k; and get this -no more refined than the 28K G I test drove. In fact all the extra wheel base is more 5 series like than 3 according to the bimmer loving soon to be in laws who claw at my G all weekend. The 3 is refined and it has the interior of a german car sure - but it can't run the road any better than a G beyond the intricacies of personal preference. ALWAYS subjectiveness here but lets take a look at what the media has to say once in a while when they consistently dub the G the class leader. I'm sure the new 3 will address this in spades.  3) Better precision machine:   Um NO. What does this mean since the car is slower and handles almost as well as a G. Does the 3 have some inbred feeling of precision that makes it feel like it can handle or acccelerate like a G when it can't...whatever it is it costs too much - WAY too much.  4) Nice looking ride: YES you are correct. The 3 is great looking and will prob be the best looking of the 1-7 series once refined to Bangles desires. At least he got 1.5 of 3 right - the 5 is growing on me again! The old 3 is a classic desing for sure - i wonder if they thought they would sell that many here - ubiquity is a sign of success. The G is like the Cowboys - OK Blueguy - The G is like J LO - either people love her or hate her.  Supercharge an M3 - Power is not lacking in an M3 but that would keep me from going far from home. With all the problems a over stroked engine already has at 9k rpm - another 140 ft/# would be a detenation waiting to happen. I'm a NA guy. PS the VQ handles about 400-500 hp FI without reinforced internals. If one had to build a car from scratch and get the most HP I know pleny of FI G's that would cause one to scratch thier head when considering a M3. Guys with 6 pounds of boost are getting 12.5's with street tires. Really does anyone FI an m3? they must really turn down the boost."
917,chrisboth,June 2004,PS I'm building my m3 now and It's 1500 just to have the paint I want.  OK 55K without too much extra is more like it. less than I thought - o wait no cd changer - jeez.
918,speedracer3,June 2004,"I'd give the ""prescision machine"" tittle to Infiniti, since they are more reliable than BMWs. I think the correct word is probably ""teutonic""."
919,designman,June 2004,"Teutonic? With Bangle as design director? Nah, those days are over."
920,speedracer3,June 2004,"Bold styling can be an advantage or a curse. Take for example Nissan and BMW.  BMW: their designs were generally appealing and handsome. Enter Bangle. Now their designs are so bold that you either love them or hate them, which will probably drive some loyal folks away. IMO... this is an example of the wrong kind of bold design.  Nissan: Especially in the 90's their cars so bland and unappeling that Honda and Toyota nearly ate Nissan for lunch. Enter Renault. Yeah, the French influence made for some wacky designs, but then again Nissan needed to take chance to get back in the game. Bold design along with good product has paid off for Nissan."

927,blueguydotcom,June 2004,"For others, like me, it is important to at least ask ""Why can't I have it all?""  One can have it all, but again it's about how you view it, not how others do. Most people say the Ferrari Modena is a great looking car. Or the Lambo cars are hot. To me they're pretty bland. I'd probably love a drive in one but it's not my kind of car.  So again it seems it should go back to what you find to be be good looking, fun to drive and exciting. I can't grasp how the opinions of others should make a shred of difference in the purchase of a car. What others think of my car is the least important aspect of my car ownership experience."
928,scott1,June 2004,"""PS - the CTS does stand out in terms of body style.""    I have to agree, but style is only part of the reason I went with a CTS. The Mercedes C class was too small, I drove an E320, which was a very comfortable size, and rode nice and smooth. It was also 58,000 as opposed to the 43,000 of my CTS, and didn't have the acceleration that the CTS has. What really scared me off of the E class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes forum.    I also checked out the Lexus...first the ES...a very quiet and refined car, but with no pretentions to sports car handling, and the rather blah looks of a Camry, and even the LS. The LS is a beautiful automobile, with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain, but again it's styling is rather bland,and it costs 58,000.     The BMW 3 series was a smooth refined car, but again, a bit cramped for my tastes .    The CTS fit the bill best for what I was looking for. Head turning style, first class sport sedan handling, a smooth refined engine and drive train, and a quiet comfortable interior and ride. The fact that there are lots more cadillac dealers in my area then mercedes, BMW, and Lexus dealers combined, didn't hurt either."
929,saugatak,June 2004,"I agree with your assessment of Caddy's Art & Science theme. A little less height would make the car's proportions much better.  I also think the corner angles are a little too sharp. Just a minor rounding/softening of the corner lines would have done the trick IMO.  The Cien is a beautiful car. V12, 750HP, decent gas mileage due to DoD, what's not to like? If it makes it to production, it'll certainly spank BMW's 760i which itself is a wonderful car.  I applaud Cadillac and Nisssan for being bold and original in their styling. Even if it doesn't quite work, it's a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today.  I feel BMW tried to be bold and certain elements of Bangle's styling work well, but there seems to be no overall theme to Bangle's designs. The Bangle butt looks like it's just been slapped on. In darker colors, Bangle's front and sides look good, in lighter colors Bangle's front and sides look disproportionally large.  I also don't think Bangle was that original. The front of the new BMW's (aside from the Dame Edna turn signals) look very much like Pontiacs, except that I like the Pontiac's proportions better.  Pontiac's goal was to become a ""poor man's BMW.""  First step of GM's plan . . . plant a mole within BMW to make BMWs look more like Pontiacs . . . mission accomplished."
930,riez,June 2004,designman... My primary consideration is how well the car performs (for its price). Looks are secondary. And I really could care less what others think about my car. I don't buy cars to impress others. I buy them to enjoy the driving experience. Guess it is the difference between being seen in a car driving down a city street and being out in middle of nowhere driving on some great long and winding roads.
931,kdshapiro,June 2004,"""Pontiac's goal was to become a ""poor man's BMW.""  Yes, that is it. BMW does not design towards GM, GM designs toward BMW. BMWs bold and innovative designs in part are to pull away from the masses and imitators. The is no denying the heritage of these brilliant designs, but the Pontiac is the flavor of the month club.  I saw somewhere else pictures of a Sebring against a 645. I was absolutely aghast at how similiar these cars looked. It was said that BMW was copying the Sebring. Then coincidentally somem time after, I saw a 645 and Sebring in the same general location in a parking lot and it was obvious these cars share the same traits as a Ferrari with a Hyundai. Pictures do lie. In person the hertiage of a Pontiac and a 5 series are also obvious.  BMW should be flattered, after all imitation is the sincerest form of flatter."

From BMWs perspective, they have engineered their cars to be safer in what they consider to be true ""Real World"" crashes and the NHTSA be damned.  Who is correct? I don't really know. That said; it takes some moxie to deliberately engineer a car that does not do well in the NHTSA tests. As such, I'm inclined to think that my BMW is more than safe enough.  Best Regards, Shipo"

Of course, the Japanese improved their cars a lot but most of their cars were not built for autobann driving (of course you can drive them to 100mph but you will not feel safe in those cars in that speed. I found they are not as ""stable"" as European cars on highway speed). European cars give me better feel from and better control on the roads too.  For Saab, they built huge mechanic mooses for their own crash test. I just feel safe in a Saab. Volvo is famous for their safety too (even though I don't have much interest on their cars). My friend has a Jetta and her car was rear-ended by a Japanese sedan. There were only few scratches on the bumper of the Jetta but there were significant damages on the Japanese car.

It was a Japanese car. He was damn lucky, I'd say.  Doesn't really mean that Japanese cars are inherently safer than German cars. Depends more on each vehicle.

I guess they really got the latest generation of airbags down... they used to go off for anything and cost 5k to repair - wonder if Spitzer looked into that LOL.  unfortuanately all the technology in crumple zones means it wont take much impact to make it look horrific and cost a lot to repair. I guess the insurance co would rather pay for a new car than for a new you as would you or I. The G has one of the worst slow speed accident costs for a 5 mph crash but that all seems forgiven when looking at offset frontal and real world accidents I've seen pics of.

954,merc1,June 2004,"I don't know about BMW, but you'd have to be living on another planet not to see the real world safety benefits of Mercedes, Volvo, Saab and even Audi.  It is no secret that BMW just recently say like in the last 10-15 years really got serious about safety, but the rest have proven their worth in real-world crashes...especially Volvo and Mercedes. They've been collecting data on their wrecked cars in real world accidents in Europe for over 40 years and you're telling us that all of this reasearch puts them on or at the same level as companies like GM or Ford in safety. These two in particular don't even know where to put gas tanks in their cars or trucks. I'd really like to see your status if a C-Class or S40 gets hit by an SUV compared to a Focus or Cavalier or Civic.  These lab tests are silly in the fact that they are controlled and very predictable. Since when is a real world accident predictable and controlled? Companies like MB and Volvo were doing safety engineering before any of these US test organizations had a clue. Amazingly now the NHTSA wants makers to address rear-end impacts and the affects it has on seats, only about 20 years after Volvo and Mercedes solved the problem. These same safey regs give American cars that have headrests (important in a rear collision) that ""rests"" in the small of your back and don't come anywhere near protecting your actual ""head"" a ""five star"" safety rating. A Kia is now as safe as a Volvo? Ok right.  There are pictures all over the net of Mercedes and Volvos that have been completely demolished up to the A-Pillar and the glass didn't even break! I'd like to see anything from Japan or American do this. The current Acura RL bent up like an accordian in the last round of testing it was subjected to. The car literally ""broke"" after the A-Pillar, not before it.  M"
955,chrisboth,June 2004,Take a look at the nhtha video of the G35 sedan offset frontal crash test. This may be the most worthwhile of all lab tests. It certainly gives the analyst and manufacturer something to go on as the offset high speed is one of the more devestating impacts. Some may think its crap but I think it saves lives as it gives terrific data to the makers. Just the last 10 years alone have seen dramatic changes for car shell design not to mention all the airbag and driver assist technology's.  Not sure where the video is - here are the results.... http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle%5Fratings/ce/html/0307.htm  There's your crumpled to the a-pillar with no windows broken shot on the right. This car is a best pick you'll notice as well. Volvo Schmolvo..they are all pretty good in this class...focus civics and cavaliers - why are those in here?
956,cdnpinhead,June 2004,"with Merc1 on this.  The U.S. simply doesn't have the driving environment to find out what happens in high-speed accidents on a regular basis, which is probably a good thing, given how most drive.  That, plus the litigious nature of American society means that giving a wrecked car back to the manufacturer for analysis isn't a highly likely event."
957,kdshapiro,June 2004,"I'm with Merc as well - The Europeans were concerned with car safety was Ford was still trying to place the gas tank on the Pinto for the best possible explosion. Japanese cars of the 70's and early 80's were also a joke.  Today in 2004 a lot of work has been done to even the playing field, but the point is the Europeans especially Mercedes, were dealing with this issue more seriously than anyone else."

Those nutjobs wrap their cars around EVERYTHING and somehow that tinny-little econo car's passenger cage is fine over and over.  Sorry, I don't buy into the hype about european cars being safer than other cars and the most specific target of such claims: japanese cars.  I've been t-boned before while in a VW Golf (truck smacked us at 40 mph) and walked away fine- the energy of the crash was absorbed around the passenger cell. At the time I though, ""Wow look how safe these German cars are"" but after really looking into it I can't say the results would have been much different if we'd been in a civic or corolla. Probably different in a bimmer, as side protection is crap but other small cars seemed to fair fine in side collisions.  Buy into the marketing, that's fine. I don't for a second believe an MB or Volvo is head and shoulders safer than any other late model Japanese luxury brand.  I don't give a hoot what MB did safety wise in 1970, 80, 90. Doesn't matter to me. The cars made today by most luxury makes - BMW accepted - appear to have leveled the playing field to the point that declaring MB safer by virtue of its history just seems incredibly bias."

WHIPS and headlight wipers    (I though it was Volvo too)  4. etc.etc...  Saab was one of the first car maker to build a production turbo car successfully (I am not sure if Saab was the first one but they were among the first group).  It seems that Saab didn't do much in the Marketing area to promote its ""unique"" features but some car-makers want you to believe they were the pioneer of certain features.

It's difficult to see the corner lights in the front of the merging car but if all cars had side maker lights, I'm sure driving would be a bit safer.

Again fit and finish was great and seating was comfortable. The ride was a little harsher than the s40 and harsher than my current tl type-s. The sound system to me was hands down much more impressive than the volvo. The seating was not as comfortable as the s40, but I preferred the seating position over the s40.  Overall I like the tl much more than the s40. The s40 was lacking in some areas, such as very small door pockets for storage and a very small console and center armrest. The s40's door armrests were very narrow when compared to the tl. They are both great cars but I definetly prefer the Acura."

I do, however, think that there is more similarity than difference between cars from the same engineering culture, and you can make (very) general statements, about control heaviness, safety(europen) vs reliability(japanese), etc. The fact is a $35K car is a $35K car, and engineers are about as good all over the world. Cars at the same price point are all about equally contented, albeit often in very different areas, and we (ought) to choose based on our wants in these areas.

1013,jrock65,July 2004,"""With the Altima you may be getting more than you bargained for in terms of time at the shop. Know several people who had them and they just couldn't wait to get rid of them.""  And as we all know, your chances of taking a car to the shop depends on how many people kdshapiro knows who've had a problem with that car.  In any case, this is probably the wrong thread to talk about Altimas."
1014,speedracer3,July 2004,"But that engine has major torque steer  Engines don't torque steer, FWD cars do.  And Nissan trannies are bad  Nissan autos are among the best in the business. Better than Honda anyday...not as good as Toyota. Honda has the best manuals, Nissan is not known for the manuals...yet I've heard their close-ratio six speed (in the 350Z) is a very good tranny."
1015,kdshapiro,July 2004,"""In any case, this is probably the wrong thread to talk about Altimas.""  So why are you talking about them?"
1016,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"Engines don't torque steer, FWD cars do.  I know exactly where the torque steer comes from and actually it is somewhat related to the engine. The tendency of FWD to exhibit torque can be tamed somewhat. What? Unequal...  It's not even worth it.  Nissan autos are among the best in the business.  I totally disagree. Nissan makes junk trannies that are clunky, slow and poorly engineered. not as bad as BMW and Ford trannies but still bad. The manuals on the G35, Altima and Max were just as bad as the one on my old Stanza. Rubbery, vague, truckline buckets of bolts.  Better than Honda anyday...not as good as Toyota. Honda has the best manuals, Nissan is not known for the manuals...yet I've heard their close-ratio six speed (in the 350Z) is a very good tranny.  Wait a second, at one moment you're saying they're better than Honda, then contradicting that by mentioning Honda's trannies are the best. What the blazes? When I mention trannies, I'm only talking about the kind of tranny that matters - manual. automatic? rather be dead."
1017,jrock65,July 2004,"When was I talking about Altimas?  I was refuting your logic, which has been recounted many times in this thread, that your anecdotal evidence can somehow apply as a generalization about a particular car."
1018,dat2,July 2004,"why altima? because what i really want is g35 6 speed, which is an awesome car, but don't really want the payments and the 32grand price tag. altima is fast, sporty and comfortable, but i understand it is not quite in this league. the reason i put it here is because no one in the altima thread has any info.  also, i am considering 6 speed maxima se, it is about 1500 more than altima, considering the markup and 1000 rebate. i can get a 6 spd max with sunroof, plus it has all safety and abs standard which altima doesn't, for about 25 grand right now at the local dealer. how is that shifter?? and torque steer??  thanks all for your thoughts."
1019,dat2,July 2004,"actually, maxse 6 sp w/ roof is about 24.5 negotiated price and alt 5 spd w/ roof is about 22.8 grand.  other alternatives, are mazda 6 hatch, love it except not enough power, and maybe the new subie legacy 2.5 turbo. also, have not driven accord coupe 6 speed but its probably in a similar ballpark."
1020,pgill,July 2004,"I own a G35x and the gas mileage is one of my biggest disappointments with the car. I have a long commute with 80% highway driving @ 75 - 80 mph and I have been averaging 20 mpg. I have over 8,000 miles on the car and I followed the break-in procedure recommended by Infiniti. There are boards dedicated to Infiniti and Infiniti G35 where other owners have posted their experiences with respect to gas mileage...perhaps those would help. You can email me if you want the sites."
1021,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"...but matched with Nissan's gearing, man does it gobble gas. Add in the weight of the AWD system and it's not a shock mileage is so bad."
1022,chrisboth,July 2004,The non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 23-25 on hiway. Not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online (6 mos ago anyway).  Like I have said - get the crawford Z plenum and up that by 3-4 mpg - I get about 28 on the hiway.  Also you aren't bnroken in until about 15k ..people are finding improvements are coming in big surprising doses well after a year of ownership.
1023,dhanley,July 2004,"Several friends who have g35's get low twenties, and this seem consistent with online reports. Expect AWD to cost about 2MPG or so.  A plenium getting 3-4MPG improvement is pure snake oil. No one with a lick os sense is going to buy that... A car cruising on the highway has the throttle at high restriction anyways, so less restriction in the intake obviously isn't going to help.  I'm not sure how much the stick shift is going to help MPG, but if you're interested in a sports sedan, this is obviously what you're going to choose. Otherwise, save your money and buy a buick."
1024,chrisboth,July 2004,Well enjoy the taste of snakeoil since all your friend get low 20's and I get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below E. DO you even know what a plenum does einstien?
1025,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"Sorry every person I know with a G35 nets 22 mpg or lower. I mention getting 30 on the freeway and a friend with a G, his eyes light up. He's delighted if he can eek out 24 mpg on a freeway trip to vegas."
1026,dhanley,July 2004,"Yes, i do. Wide-flow plenums sometimes do increase high-end power, especially when turbos or superchargers are involved. But when throttle is mostly closed ( as when a 3.5L engine is noodling along on the highway ) and vacuum is high, increasing airflow to the engine obviously isn't going to drive MPG way up.  To quote the ednumds test:  ""We're also unsure as to the fuel economy outlook with the all-wheel-drive system, as our test vehicle averaged only 15.4 miles per gallon while in our care.""  ""and I get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below E.""  The g35 has a 20 gallon tank. 440/20=22MPG. So that means you get maybe 23MPG? You're still doing better than other people i know. My 7+ year old BMW with a 17 gallon tank has gotten over 550 miles on a tank.  dave"
1027,chrisboth,July 2004,http://www.kptechnologies.net/chris/chris_race.htm  Proof is right here in terms of power increases anyway.  Try again with real math. Since I wont brave using the 5 gallon reserve I fill up at E on the nose. Let's be conservative and say that there are 4 of 20 gallons left so 440/16=27.5. Pretty good and obviously there is better math with a fillup for actual gallons.  The stock plenum is choking the front bank of cylinders for air. A less restrictive plenum doesn't allow for more air it allows the SAME air to work more efficently by more equally sharing the airflow and distribution of that airflow. Lots of people doubt this snakeoil plenum adds any power either and thats why enthusiasts race and test and race and test and the rest of the daisy drivers wonder and live with things the way they are.  I didn't get from 15 to 14.2 in the quarter mile with twin turbos - a pulley and a plenum is all it takes. $750 total
1028,chrisboth,July 2004,PS can your 7 year old BMW keep up with a golf?
1029,dhanley,July 2004,Nope. Those guys have magnets that polarize their fuel and double their horsepower--made by the same guys selling you your plenum and pulley.  dave
1030,chrisboth,July 2004,I noticed it's the beemer guys who doubt this the most. Just like the coupe guy did until I schooled him on the ways of Crawford Z engineering - noe he sports one too!.... enjoy your 318i. :0  Putting new design plenum on G35....$390  Consulting with several memebers of dedicated website for 12 months and running dynos to verify results while consulting with engineer....$200  Airmchair racing and armchair engineering that conclude diddly: PRICELESS
1031,dhanley,July 2004,"Like i said, anyone who understands how engines work is not going to be fooled by this--even the crawford Z web site says that the plenum only makes a difference (adding horsepower) at high RPM's.  Since you already inadvertantly admitted getting ~22mpg in your buick(autotranny) g35, i don't know why you're getting so excited about this."
1032,speedracer3,July 2004,"My Maxima did terrible gas mileage ~18 mpg, but then again I didn't get the car for its fuel economy. I wouldn't expect the G35 to be fuel efficient, I would just enjoy the performance at each fill up.  My A4 gives me the best of both worlds though. I get fast reflexes and 26 mpg. Couldn't be happier."
1033,chrisboth,July 2004,"I inadvertantly admitted this exactly:  ""The non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 23-25 on hiway. Not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online (6 mos ago anyway). ""  Your reading comprehension must be better than you allude with your argument. 23-25 is not bad and the math works out if you get out your calculator and concentrate.  Anyone who understands how engines work would recognize the value of having all 6 cylinders get equal airflow. You may not believe it but most used car buyers wishing they could even keep up with the last generation camary are not worth convincing.  Horsepower added at higher rpm's is a sypmtom of the greater efficency. If you believe the plenum helps HP then what is your explanation for why hotshot? Whatever your answer it can be applied to the fuel efficiency argument so you must believe two contradicting things...not worth the time anymore but fun during a meeting that is over...come back if you get a real car and want to learn something"
1034,dhanley,July 2004,"That's just not how it works. In situations where the throttle is wide open, airflow is an issue. At low RPM's on highway drives, there is a high level of vacuum in the plenum already, and airflow is slow--nothing is going to get starved. Even the developers of the plenum say this. I know you unfortunately can't cope with a manual transmission, but there is a thing on the dash called a tachometer that will help you see highways RPM's.  By the way, if by getting our calculator out and concentrating you conclude that 440/20 = 23-25, then i see why we're having problems communicating.  dave"
1035,sweetc230,July 2004,I'm averaging 18mpg in the city (aggressive driving of course) and on the highway this past holiday weekend I averaged 26mpg!!! I was blown away. Keep in mind that my '03 G35 coupe is used and has about 25K miles; so this could support the argument that the gas mileage gets better with age. But 26mpg is definitely surprising for a car like this. Just my .02 for what its worth.
1036,chrisboth,July 2004,"I suggested that you get the calulcator i work with numbers all day. Just suggest you follow along since you mis-quoted me. Also while you drive your 5 speed and think everyone else that has an auto can not, remember that you are special and people really do like you even if you aspire to own a camry.  When I need a manual I can always turn to the real speed demon the zx-11 ninja. If you need schooled on shifing I can teach you, but I'd have to charge.  And while you're at take some classes on engine design. Bolt ons are one thing...fundametally changing the intake is another. You babble about throttle positioning...who cares...what matters is the SAME AIR (please dont repsond until you get this) is more evenly distributed. Stop choking the front 2 cylinders and you dont need to open the throttle as much whether there's a vacuum or not.  I'd be jealous of G owners too - we are having alot of fun. Save up and you can have 300hp someday too."
1037,cheerioboy26,July 2004,"I have 28K on my 03 G 5AT sedan. Overall mileage is 19.4. Not sure what % of total miles are city/highway, but driving 70-75 mph on I-95 will get me 24-25 mpg when the traffic allows. Driving all-around town in the cold DC winter gets me only 17-18 mpg. This time of year I get around 20 in about 80% city driving. EPA is 18/26, and considering the ""26"" figure is attained by never crossing 60 mph on the EPA test, my numbers seem realistic.  pgill - EPA AWD figures are 17/24. 20 mpg doesn't seem all that bad at 75-80 mph. There's no way you can expect to get 24 mpg at that speed, given the way the EPA comes up with their figures."
1038,dhanley,July 2004,Cute little insults. I'd better start working lots harder so i can afford a less expensive car.  dave
1039,chrisboth,July 2004,Right beemer buyers insist on paying more! Look it's been fun - reacting to someone who's got no real contextual experince to draw from teaching those who have it based on your so called knowledge. You didn't expect a boquet?  I wouldn't be so adamant about things you know little about in real world context unless you like abuse. Reality speaks volumes and theorizing is a waste of the modders time.  You didn't pay G prices for a 328 did you? Hopefully you just didn't update your profile and you have a 540. Then you'd be able to hang!
1040,jmess,July 2004,"The coupe is a pretty noisy car though. For a stock sport/lux 75dBA at 70 MPH is pretty boy racer by today's standards. Cars like the IS300, 3 series, and CTS are under 70 dBA at the same speed."
1041,chrisboth,July 2004,Not sure about you but last time I heard the VQ roar in the coupe it made me want to drive hard and fast...why else did I pay 35k for a car! That sound is awesome. You want quiet get an avalon. These sounds are meant to be heard. Theres a reason the IS is muffled - it's sounds like &^$*&
1042,speedracer3,July 2004,"The G35 coupe should be noisy because it is a sports (a wolf in sheep's clothing). Call it what you will, but the G35 mechanically, is a 350Z with better styling."
1043,designman,July 2004,"I agree with both of you. Engines are sweet music... no engine, no sport. I like the 350Z styling with reservations on the rear lights. Altima also has buttoned-up styling and I believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched. The rest of the Nissan/Infiniti lineup needs serious help with styling. At least they have three, BMW has 1/2."
1044,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"Love the styling of the G35 coupe, but didn't like the cramped interior, poor visibility, lack of a trunk, cheap interior materials, balky shifter and numb steering. I felt like I was sitting in a cheap, dark, small hole when driving the coupe.  I like the sedan way more. A far better, though far less sexy looking car, IMHO.  Now a drop top G35 coupe - that would at least remove the closed-in, tight, dank hole feeling. And supposedly Infiniti is making the interior decent on the next batch of Gs.  Why are they not doing that yet? come on, BMW is the only luxury coupe maker with an entry level convertible. No, the A4 is not a consideration, that porky pig VW-mobile."
1045,chrisboth,July 2004,Love the sedan but find the coupe to be a sexy beaa^!$. I may never own a coupe at my height. 911 is never gonna happen until I shrink. My crx had moe legroom than my G tho - no back seat. You were sitting on a beach chair in that car with my 38 inch legs upto my cheeks. sorry off topic
1046,designman,July 2004,3-series convertibles. Cool. Always were. Pray that they have come to their senses.
1047,sweetc230,July 2004,"Wow, I have never read a review like that about a coupe. Cramped interior??? it's a coupe, what did you expect?? And for a coupe, it has a VERY spacious interior. What coupe, in your opinion, has a spacious interior? Lack of a trunk?? Again, its a coupe, and I can get my golf bag and two suitcases in there. And if that's not enough, I could drop the backseat (although I haven't had to do that yet). Cheap interior. . .well, that seems to be a universal thought, but I happen to like the interior. And I love the nav system and it's location. But you are right, some of the interior materials could be scratched very easily. . .I tread lightly in mine with any sharp objects. Balky shifter? well, maybe a notchy shift action, but ok. And lastly, numb steering. . . .NUMB STEERING!!??? This is my biggest beef. . .no way, the steering is excellent, almost perfectly weighted and neutral. To draw a comparison, I would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old. Not the new ""active steering"" that they have now. My father in law has a '99 328 and I have always loved the handling/steering feel is his car and the G's steering feels the same.  But, hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none!!:)  And BTW, according to my Infiniti dealer, the G35 convertible should hit the showrooms by '06."
1048,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"What coupe, in your opinion, has a spacious interior?  3 series coupe is spacious. I wouldn't own one but it's pretty darn roomy.  Not enough space in the trunk. The rear suspension is so high that the trunk is essentially unusable.  Balky shifter? well, maybe a notchy shift action, but ok.  Not too much of a knock. I think BMW has worse trannies and I still bought a 330i. I at least trust the nissan tranny will last.  And lastly, numb steering. . . .NUMB STEERING!!??? This is my biggest beef. . .no way, the steering is excellent, almost perfectly weighted and neutral. To draw a comparison, I would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old.  Sorry, the steering reminded me of the IS300 - dead, no feedback and very slow to respond to inputs. To each his own.  But, hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none!!:)  Gorgeous styling. I'd like a character line in the middle of the door but other than that...wow.  And BTW, according to my Infiniti dealer, the G35 convertible should hit the showrooms by '06.  Oh yummy, one more choice when the bimmer goes back to the dealer. A g35 convertible could be the hottest thing on the road in a long time. Of course if there's an BMW M2 coming and MazdaSpeed3 hatchback out i'll have so many fun choices.  Looking forward to 2006!"
1049,chrisboth,July 2004,"""3 series coupe is spacious.""  ha thats cuz it's not really a sports coupe now is it - it's a sedan door with 2 doors missing. Infiniti got it right when they made the two very distinct yet they are really the same inside..just like all of us...(ok no more beer at lunch)  AS far as steering goes there is only one question: were you on pain killers or driving a bogus wrecked demo?"
1050,blueguydotcom,July 2004,"I find the steering to be ""off"" on all G's to be honest but it was worse in the coupe. Very dead center feel to it, no feedback and slow to react. not a criticism, just how it felt to me. I found the steering of the 3 and the TSX far more engaging. Heck, recently the steering setup on my protege feels more responsive and better than that of even my 3 series ZHP (but that's more related to those wretched, slick, pathetic Potenza S-03s).  Also the substantial weight of the cars plays a role. The most engaging car on the road that I've driven is still without a doubt the Miata. Point and shoot. Flick it left, right, sideways - you move that wheel and the car reacts without pause or shifting of weight or lumbering along (like the G35 and 330i do)."
1051,jmess,July 2004,"Were not talking about acceleration or WOT noise, were talking about a steady 70 MPH cruise. Say what you want but 75 dBA is loud and tiring after many hours in the car. Any continuous sound over 64-66 dBA causes hearing loss over time. If you are smart you will wear ear plugs on longer trips."
1052,fedlawman,July 2004,"If it looks anything like the 350Z, I'd pass. I hate all these convertable ""sports cars"" that have a cowl line even with your ear lobes and the top of the windshield covering half your head.  And then, every time I see someone driving one with the top-down, they have all the windows rolled up.  Why bother?  I think a convertable should actually be OPEN, like a Miata or Alfa Romeo Spider."
1053,dhanley,July 2004,"I noticed that in my buddy's g35--he has the sport package, and the road noise was really amazingly loud. I love WOT engine noise, but i often take 4+ hour highway drives and i know how tiresome the droning can be--my old car did it, and 5 hours was draining. Of course, if you're having fun, it's not a problem."
1054,merc1,July 2004,"""Altima also has buttoned-up styling and I believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched.""  Bingo!  I made this same point about everyone adopting this crease a little while back. Mercedes' 2005 SLK, Toyota's Sienna, Honda's Accord, Cadillac's new STS, and CTS all have it, and upcoming Mercedes and VWs will have it too, and just like you stated with varying degress of success.  I personally don't care for this styling element on Mercedes where is pure fluffery, but it does work on some of the Japanese cars probably because they had nowhere but up to go in terms of styling. It works on the Altima.  M"
1055,chrisboth,July 2004,This must be a Coupe thing as the wheel wells are in the interior rear deck area. My sedan is a joy at 100 - even quiet music is audible and conversations are quiet at that speed.
1056,dhanley,July 2004,"Do you have the sport package?  That's the one thing i really remmeber from driving the CTS with the 3.6L. *REALLY* quiet. Too much so in fact, for me. Also slightly uncommunicative, but the one i drove didn't have the sport package. That might cancel out my two main objections."
1057,chrisboth,July 2004,yes - wind noise is pretty great and so is cruising engine speed. It's loud when you put your foot in it and thats it. PS I have the 350-z intake tube so I have a louder sound than most sedans do. The coupe has diff exhasust and that may be more dramatic than an intake from the passenger and driver perspective.
1058,m4d_cow,July 2004,"there are only 3 things that really turn me off from getting a g35 ever: material quality is crappy seats are really hard and uncomfy, particularly on longer trips ride is harsh for a sedan at this level btw im talking about the sedan, never tried the coupe but i like it more that its brother 350Z  dhanley: how does the CTS handle, compared to others like BMW and G35?"
1059,dhanley,July 2004,"I had a hard time gauging how it handled. It ""felt"" very like a german car. It felt a lot like a c-class, a bit better steering, but more isolated. But the c-class i drove that day had a sport package and the CTS didn't.  Who knows, those GM card points may yet come in handy.  daver"
1060,oneandonly1,August 2004,"I purchased a 2002 C320 in December 2003, and also got a great deal. Paid about $28k, and this one was fully loaded with the CD changer, phone cradle, heated seats, etc. Best things was it only had 10k miles on it, couldn't believe it.  1. Service with Mercedes Benz has been great. The car is still under warranty, and coverage has never been an issue even though I am not the original owner. I have 20k miles on it now, and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty. And regular maintenance/oil changes/tire rotation are all free!!  2. I have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond: the cupolder has chrome button marked ""push"" that was chipping, so they replaced it; instrument had a smudle so they replaced it; spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it. Only problem I have had is there was a whining noise when I would make a turn, and turns out it was the power steering. They replaced the power steering pump. Best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced.  3. I have the phone cradle for a Motorola V60. I was thrilled when I got the car because I already had a V60. But then I found out that it has to be a Mercedes Benz V60. You know, its a contract between MB and Motorola so they have to get you somehow. I found the phone on ebay for about $200 and its been worth every penny. I have service through Verizon, and live in CA. Love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers, and dial through the number pad on the radio.  4. Bottom line, I love the car. Had it for 7 months now and don't regret buying it. What I can recommend is that while its under warranty, take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small. I've always driven Hondas or Nissans, but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package."
1061,Weazell,August 2004,"Thanks for all the great feedback! I just keep getting more and more excited about the prospect of owning this car. I hope to nail things down this weekend.  I've already had a great experience with MB customer service. I called our local dealership to ask a couple of questions - including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record. Not only were they willing to do that (even though I wouldn't be buying the car from them) but they faxed it over to me! Although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year, all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else. The one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled ""Rubber Mount, Torsion Bar."" I'm going to give them a call to find out a bit more but I suspect it won't keep me from moving ahead with the purchase. (Assuming I can bring the price down just a bit more.)  Thanks again!"
1062,jmess,August 2004,"The more systems a things has the more potential for problems/issues. So Benz, BMW, and etc tend to have a lot of features and gadgets that could have issues over time. Some makers like Lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect.  My uncle had to special order his corolla to get one without electric windows. He figured he would have the car for a long time and it was one less thing that could break."
1063,chalkpie,August 2004,"Was really interested in a TL (did the test drive, etc) until by chance I visited the local Saab dealer. They were offering a leftover 2003 9-5 Aero with every option imaginable for $32+. Color is metallic green with gray interior. Had 100 miles on it, with plastic still on the seats, etc.  To make a long story short, and after a LOT of haggling, I ended up buying this car for $27,500 + tax. I test drove this car the same day as the TL, and I honestly loved both cars equally. Apples and oranges. I couldn't justify spending the extra $2,500 (minimum) to get the TL. In other words, the TL didn't blow me away to the point where I was saying ""This is the car I MUST own..."" I am on a tight budget, so this figure was ideally the amount that I wanted to spend on a car. Yes it is an '03, not an '04, but at that price I couldn't turn it down.  Will pick up the car this Monday (August 6) and I hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with Saab.  I know I would have loved the TL as well, but for this time around I am going Swedish, not Japanese. I am trading in my '98 Eclipse GS-T with 136k miles. I will miss my little Eclipse."

Impressions?  GS430 - good power and good handling, nice but outdated interior layout/design (CD changer in glovebox, poorly designed center console/storage, etc.). This car needs to be re-styled, inside and out.  S430 - nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large car(this car really attacked the corners!). Interior was high class, but somewhat cold/uninviting with some quirky ergonomics.  G35 - best drive of the bunch! Brakes very grabby (took some finesse), but wonderful power, exhaust note, and cornering. Interior layout/quality is this cars Achilles heel (it was a 2004).  IS300 - not as hard edged as I remember. Light and nimble handling, decent power, yet at a disadvantage vs. competition. Interior looked and felt cramped, uninviting, and low-rent (well, my wife liked the speedometer).  330i - More powerful than IS300, but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise (slightly more ""mush"" in the steering, suspension, and throttle response. Interior a step or two up from IS300 and G35, but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap.  LS430 - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips. Plush, warm and inviting interior (suede headliner, big comfy seats, everything soft-touch). Nice straight-line power, but a pig in the twisties.  TL - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips, but only had $30K to spend. Basically felt like a lower-rent LS430...nice power and plush modern interior, but soft driving dynamics.  ES330 - My wife drove this one. She liked it, I didn't. A Camry dressed in Lexus clothing.  Conclusions? If someone could build a $30K ish car that drives/sounds like the G35, and has the interior of the TL, they'd get my money.  P.S. The longest line was for the Cadillac XLR. It's kinda ugly, but it goes like heck, sounds awesome, and corners on rails!"
1066,kdshapiro,August 2004,"Nice writeup. If I could be driving an LS430, I would be driving a 745. If my budget was an absolute $30K, it would be a loaded Honda. I would rather drive a loaded Honda than a stripper 325. If I had 40K, the 3 series performance package."
1067,ponytrekker,August 2004,You should seriously consider Lexus if long-term reliability is a concern.
1068,jrock65,August 2004,"Official photos of the next 3 have been released. Less controversial looking than the 5 or the 7, and has a little more pizzaz than the current 3. Not what evokes ""wow, beautiful"" or ""handsome"", but not bad either.  But I'm not a big fan of the new interior. Seems pretty bland. There seems to be both a idrive version and a non-idrive version, at least for euro models.  Of course, I'll have to reserve final judgment until I actually see the car and sit in it."
1069,kdshapiro,August 2004,"""Not what evokes ""wow, beautiful"" or ""handsome"", but not bad either.""  It's a much more modern, handsome/athletic design than the now date 6 year old 3 series. I think they'll be gorgeous in person."

1073,exalteddragon1,August 2004,"Did you have a chance to drive a Cadillac CTS, or the new STS?  I think the CTS with the new 3.6 is a better choice than the G35 if they were equal in price, but a similarly equipped (to the teeth) G35 is like 5K less than the CTS, which runs into the 40's.  It would be intersting to see how the STS does against the 430, aswell..."

1075,fedlawman,August 2004,"The XLR was the only Cadillac there. I would have liked to have seen/driven the new STS.  As for the CTS, they could put a fusion power unit in it, and it would still be ugly to me."
1076,kasperghost,August 2004,"I have been lurking in vain for the answer to my questions. I would appreciate some feedback if possible. I live in Colorado and need to know if there are any other Coloradans or people that have driven I-70 over Eisenhower tunnel in a 325i loaded with people (10,000 ft up). I used to have a Honda Prelude w/ a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 19.3 lbs. and the 325i has a 16.3 power to weight. I would be luggin' extra weight due to 4 people. The Honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit. The Honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i (relative to their respective competitors). I'd like to buy new and the 325i is the most I can afford. (Mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup...:) I'm looking at this being a 100k car; that's why I am not looking at a used 330i.  Somehow, I'd feel cheated if I spent all that money and couldn't get up the hill."
1077,kyfdx,August 2004,"but, the BMW has plenty of torque and horsepower for any high-speed driving you need to do.. If your Prelude could handle it, you have nothing to worry about with 325i.  regards, kyfdx"

1079,kasperghost,August 2004,"I agree that the Subaru would have the power especially with the turbo giving such outstanding high altitude performance- I read the first drive on the front page of Edmunds and wasn't impressed with the engine review. I drove the 325 the other day and be still my beating, no pounding heart. It drives like people say it does. I'm not too worried about the winters. We get the most sunshine out of any magor city in the US. All things being equal, I want the BMW. My only other contender is the TL, but 270 out of a fwd?  Thanks for any input"

1081,rickrover,August 2004,"I've owned several BMW's, mostly 3 Series, most recently an 01 X5 which just went off lease. In the past when my BMW lease was up I'd either turn it in and pick out a new one or purchase the old one - not this time. I liked the X5, never had a problem with it but grew tired of driving an SUV type vehicle and decided a ""sport wagon"" would fit my requirements. The 3 series is too small and due to be replaced next year, don't care for the 5 at all.  I'd decided on an Audi A4 Avant Ultrasport - had one on order.  Then I happened upon the Legacy GT wagon, my first test drive was an eye opener. It reminded me of a BMW, steering, handling, power delivery, amenities, material quality, etc.. On the way home from the test drive I started doubting my perception of it - It couldn't have been that good.  When I got home the latest issue of Bimmer magazine was in my mailbox, imagine my suprise when the Bimmer editor had test driven the new Legacy GT at Laguna Seca with a bunch of other cars - here are the comments:  ""Driving on public roads tends to reveal less about a car's performance than driving on a fast track like Laguna Seca, but the first day's driving in the hills east of Monterey yielded at least one revelaton: The Subaru Legacy GT has become a genuine rival to the 3 Series. Not only has Subaru made incredible strides where interior quality is concerned, but the car is fast (250 hp from its turbocharged 2.5-liter flat four) and involving. It's a thoroughly engaging driver's car with precise, neutral handling and perfect steering.""  So I wasn't going nuts after all -  Took the GT wagon (manual) for another test drive, confirmed my earlier impressions, signed on the dotted line and cancelled the Audi.  A month later I'm still very satisfied with my choice - waiting till 3k for the first oil change."
1082,billyperks,August 2004,Is there such a car as a C430? Is that in the Mercedes line?
1083,nbfc260,August 2004,There is no such car as a C430. If you are talking about the E430 they changed it to an E500 and that is a bigger car.
1084,kyfdx,August 2004,"I was just assuming he was talking about the CLK430.. and I didn't even check the Ebay listing close.. I just assumed that was the coupe as well.. Who would have guessed that there was a demand for the C55? Especially, since the old C43 was such a bust before.  You learn something new everyday.. Hey! At least I found one in stock!!  regards, kyfdx"
1085,buddhabman,August 2004,"Most of the new AWD cars with 300HP don't have high redlines. 6000-7000 max like a good majority of cars. The STi, the S60/V70R both have normal redlines, I believe the same is true for the S4 db.  Needless to say you probably don't need more than 200-250hp to have great fun in a sports sedan. But as the sports luxury cars get a bit heavier with all the luxury and safety for example the Audi S4 need the benefit of the additional HP.  But this power is tractable, you just need a track to get all tractable power usage. :-)"

1087,buddhabman,August 2004,"Rickover - Nice to hear someone who has driven a BMW 3 series does appreciate that the Subarus have greatly improved. Since 1999, the US version Legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor. They finally refined the whole package.  So now I am lobbying again for the Subaru Legacy GT Limited for inclusion in this topic. This is what Edmunds editors say:  ""The Bottom Line: Now a legitimate entrant in the entry-level luxury category, the new Legacy will change how people view the Subaru brand.""   But I also think the Volvo S60/V70 R Types should be included. They fall in the same price range and luxury content range."
1088,dhanley,August 2004,"Personally, i think it would make more sense, and i said before, to start a tp ""is the subaru gt a luxury car?""  If we open the topic, it will just allow others to be considered for includion. Pontiac bonneville, GTO, loaded camries and accords, etc.  I drive a 3 series, and have looked at the subies, and while i have liked some aspect of them i haven't others: really cheap interiors, poor gas mileage, and boomy construction. I haven't looked at a 2005 so i can't ascertain if it's improved, but i wasn't impressed by the ""9-2""  dave"
1089,billyperks,August 2004,why not add the Kia Amanti and the Sonata GLS. It is really getting ridiculous on this board.

1091,blueguydotcom,August 2004,"Entry lux cars come from the BOTTOM of what that brand offers. The G35, 3 series, IS300 and C class are bottom of the barrel for their luxury brands. They get you into a lux brand and from there the brand expects you'll move up. The cruddiest things made by BMW, Infiniti and MB are the 325, IS300 and C.  You can't spice up your top end car and declare it's now entry level lux. Entry level lux indicates there's something more expensive and better higher up to aspire to. Hence the word ENTRY.  As long as the Imprezza and Forester are available from Subaru and there isn't something on par with a 5/E or 7/A8 then it's not a luxury brand. And therefore they can't be selling an entry level lux."

1093,blueguydotcom,August 2004,It seems like the most logical way to break it down. The 3 series really is the entry level car for the BMW line.  Nobody would call a 30k Subaru - no matter how cool and fast - the entry level vehicle for that brand.

So other cars should be entered but, it wont happen after reading 142 pages i have seen that you are very stubborn about the cars enlisted; even if it is stupid."

1098,riez,August 2004,"Can't figure out why so many worry so much about what this boar is about. The title is moderately self explanatory. This board is about SEDANS that are both:  1. Performance-oriented AND 2. Entry-level luxury  So top-of-their line luxury sedans like Acura RL don't qualify. Nor do non-performance sedans like Lexus ES330. And coupes like the G35 coupe or GTO are immediately disqualified.  So some of the best fits that immediately come to mind are sedans like the 325i, G35, and IS300. Then others, like the X-type or C-class, come to mind. Does that mean there will be some gray area, like with the Acura TSX and TL? Sure, but that is part of the fun of trying to compare cars."

1112,minnehaha,September 2004,"S60R is a boat. It may go fast but it doesn't like it. The turbo lag is impressive. The brakes felt mushy. It is very quiet (good) but it makes it hard to shift (bad). I actually got quite sea sick driving it! The radio designer should be shot. Still it is pretty, you wife with like it, it is safe and resell is good. You just will hate it until you resell it. Save 10 grand and look at the Subaru Legacy GT if you want performance or the Acura TL if you want comfort. Both are good balanced players in power verses comfort."
1113,volvodan1,September 2004,"A boat? I haven't heard that one yet. It is fast, handles well, and is more comfortable than the Legacy or TL. Both are very good but to call the S60R a boat is crazy."
1114,ephemere,September 2004,"minnehaha: The Legacy GT is a fine car, especially going in a straight line on the highway, where it reaches extra-legal speeds in no time and feels good doing it. Significant body roll and understeer greatly reduces the fun factor for me, but it is a car I might recommend as a comfortable family hauler.  The Volvo S60R/V70R, however, is in a different class altogether. Faster, way more stable, feels lighter, much more agile, very fun to drive. In addition, the exterior and interior aesthetic design, as well as the quality of the interior materials (particularly the leather), are in another league."
1115,johncdnrockies,September 2004,"Enjoy the banter and wouldn't want to take you folks off the track of approved vehicles, but the S60R is a very nice package indeed. I bought an '04 XC70 in July (a dog by comparison), but drove the R series many times for comparison. It flies and has a nicer interior (vs the Legacy) to boot. If it hadn't been for the narrow seats (my problem with a cracked spine) I would have plumped for it.  For the record we also owned a 325 and currently have a C320. Both are different from the S60R but I sure wouldn't describe the latter as a boat.  John"
1116,m4d_cow,September 2004,"not a boat i say, though the extremely complicated audio controls really turn me off kinda like volvo version of i-drive its a decent handler though no match to beemers or audi"
1117,buddhabman,September 2004,"If you are gonna call these boats then they are nice speed boats. :-). The interiors are great, for these 2 models they are equal to the A4 / A6 Audis and better than the corresponding BMW and MB sedans.  I like these cars and the XC90 although I will probably never buy a Volvo due to the crappy treatment I got from a dealer in Santa Monica a few years back. I might eat my words when the XC90 with V8 comes out.  I do question the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the Legacy. The Legacy is lighter by 300 lbs. They are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in Volvo DNA. The steering feel in a Legacy is more precise IMHO. Good brakes are standard for Volvo though. Comparing to the Benz or BMW in the price range for snow duty I would get the Volvo.  Comparing it to the Legacy GT, if you got the extra dough the Volvo is awesome."
1118,r34,September 2004,"I think Volvo did something good to have S60R and the new S40 (esp T5).  For the other Swedan car maker, Saab, they need to work harder. Many people think that their technology is outdated and the 9-3 interior not not good.  Well, I looked at the 2006 A4 report in Edmunds yesterday. It mentioned that Audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to A4 to minimize vibration.  ""Balance shafts"" ? Sounds familiar. I checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner's manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. I am not sure when Saab put those in their cars.  I remembered I asked an Audi Salesperson whether the auto tranny of an A4 can learn the driver's driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no.  I think Saab has some nice and unique features that they didn't mention to people. Not that many people know Saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seats, etc. The Marketing dept should be responsible for that.  Now 9-3 is more mainsteam. Maybe most people like it better than the old one. I missed the hatch. It needs something more than 210hp. Saab should create something like the Viggen with AWD for the 9-3 (I heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but AWD may not be an option)."
1119,dhanley,September 2004,"Hmm--that was how i felt about the '900 i used to have. That car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings. I also had the BMW then, which had fewer ""gee, neat"" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about. For example, the BMW engine didn't have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn't have the turbo lag either. The saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the BMW but i miss that car in general.  I recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5. I really like them both but each had something that made me say ""wait"" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new ARC. Both manual transmission. The 9-5's bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3's was the el cheapo GM interior. Both could be fixed, of course. I think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it's a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight distribution) with less turbo lag. The ecotec is also smoother. Another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick. You have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts. It's find if you're driving ""all out"" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic. Sort of the opposite of the GTO my cousin wants me to get. Even with my BMW i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.  The lack of the hatch also miffed me.  Still, I'd rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly ""reliable."" Kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring. And there's something about the saab that i at least want to like.  The new s40 really intrigues me. It seems to have impressive environmental credentials, which i know a lot of you probably don't care about that much so i'll shut up about that.  dave"
1120,igiban,November 2004,"kd, That 8714 number includes more than B3 sedans (incl. also coups, convertibles...) although I am not sure what'd be the # for sedans only.  It's arguable whether TL/TSX or ES/IS should be combined comparing to 325/330. TL is not the same car as TSX, but 325 does not have the same engine as 330's either. Maybe you can compare TL with 330 and TSX with 325. But the 'smaller' 325 actually sells a lot more than the more powerful 330, opposite to TL vs. TSX or ES vs. IS. There's no easy way to really match up."

1123,riez,November 2004,"Take the sales figures and divide by the number of dealers that marque has. Thinking a ""small"" marque like Infiniti has around 175-200 dealers. So they are selling a good number of cars per dealer per month. Not so much so for a ""large"" marque like Cadillac, which has a lot more dealers. Their average dealer moves few CTSs each month.  Acura dealers are moving a ton of cars per month!!! Same for Lexus! And cars comprise only about half of Lexus' sales; other half are SUVs.  If you could have a franchise, which one would you want?"
1124,cdnpinhead,November 2004,It's called attention to detail.  The month we're discussing is October.  You're welcome.
1125,kdshapiro,November 2004,"True what you say, but one can also say except for price and engine output the M3, 330i and 325i can be *almost* (I did say almost) identically configured. Additionally each vehicle has almost the same engine and has the same vehicle chassis, same leg room, same cup holders, same radio etc.  That is not true with TL/TSX. Two totally separate vehicles."
1126,dhanley,November 2004,"I know you're ""discussing"" October; I am making fun of how stupid the whole discussion is.  It's called comprehension."
1127,igiban,November 2004,"Well that's just how Asian cars and Euro cars are made. Audi/bmw/mb all do that. Make the same chassis/look for a 'model' but then equip them with a wide range of engines in terms of power and config. Lexus/acura/infinity, on the other hand, go by one model-one engine approach. There's nothing wrong either way, but they do present a matching difficulty in comparison. I think people do cross shop 325/330 against TSX and TL, or IS and ES, both."
1128,riez,November 2004,"igiban... Not sure I agree too much with you when you write, ""I think people do cross shop 325/330 against TSX and TL, or IS and ES, both.""  I can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing FWDers like TL, TSX (the Euro-Accord), and ES to each other, but find it hard to see them comparing a RWD car, say a 330i or IS300, to a FWD car, like the ES330 or TSX. One drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars.  Marques that use one platform to compete across a broad market segment or many segments usually rely on lots of options, including engines, and available AWD. The 3 Series is somewhat unique in that it also includes station wagon, convertible, coupe, and M.  Lexus chooses to use two entirely different platforms. Infiniti used to until they dropped the I35, now relying on the G35 with its AWD and coupe versions to compete broadly. But it does cost more to develop and market two entirely different platforms, esp. when one (the ES) handily outsells the other (the IS)."
1129,kdshapiro,November 2004,People cross shop anything. What they cross shop has no bearing on how sales numbers are presented. Sure you can say Acura sells more TLs than BMW sells 330is. But that doesn't tell any picture. Even the sales numbers don't say anything. By the sales numbers BMW should have canned the 330i a long time ago.
1130,kdshapiro,November 2004,"To some people, this is very important. To some people that fact that MacDonalds sells billions and billions is more important than the fact Christy's Steak Haus sells hundreds and hundreds."

1132,fedlawman,November 2004,"""I can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing FWDers like TL, TSX (the Euro-Accord), and ES to each other, but find it hard to see them comparing a RWD car, say a 330i or IS300, to a FWD car, like the ES330 or TSX. One drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars.""  I didn't realize that I am uninformed and irrational. Thanks for enlightening me!"
1133,wco81,November 2004,"For instance, are A4 sales dwindling? What was the sales of the current A4 at their peak?  Looks like IS is on it's last legs.  TSX, looks like people are just paying more to get the TL."
1134,riez,November 2004,"fedlawman... The driving dynamic difference between FWDers and RWDers is pretty obvious. Have you driven these cars back to back seriously on a decent test drive?  I had an ES330 loaner a few weeks ago. Didn't drive anything like my IS300. Didn't take me 5 minutes to figure out they were entirely two different cars with two different missions. When I looked at Infiniti a few years ago, I drove a G35 and an I35. Difference between night and day.  Of course, I do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems, cupholders, and wood trim than they do driving dynamics.  My focus on this board is on performance, not luxury. If you reverse the importance, you can readily come up with different results. And as the sales demonstrate, more buyers are interested in luxury over performance."
1135,igiban,November 2004,"is just, well, sales #. I never said it should necessarily mean anything. I merely pointed out that one should compare sedans to sedans at least, and between different approaches to 'package' a model's size, power, and powertrain... etc. from various makes, it's not easy to draw a (me better than you) conclusion. Drawing anything more from the above out of my words then you might be reading too sensitively. Relax.  As to whether people cross shop RWD cars to FWD cars, I think so. I am not saying everyone does that or it's right or wrong either way. From what I know many, admittedly perhaps mass average drivers, are flexible in terms of getting a FWD or RWD car, esp. in Cal. It's one of the factors, but often not the most important one, unless climate dictates. Even people who buy RWD cars, like many of my bimmer friends, admit they don't tell much difference on their day to day driving between their bimmers and, say their old Hondas. Well, maybe they'd not spend the $extra$ to get a bimmer as they can't fully appreciate the extra capability, but then, they might have gotten a bimmer for reasons other than just RWD."

I researched and planned our BMW purchase for over a year.. with many discussions with my wife, etc..  And.. one month after we bought it.. my wife asked me if it was RWD or FWD.. and, its her car!!  The others are correct.. all of these cars get cross-shopped... Those ""major"" differences to me and you.. are just minor things to the vast majority..  regards, kyfdx"
1137,cdost1,November 2004,"Folks,  Looking for a car. Here is the decision tree.  1. Should I go pre-owned certified with a late model Audi A6 ? 2. Should I go for a new entry level luxury sedan ?  I am trying to keep the price in the mid 30's. For the new entry level I have really not narrowed it down much. I have read some of the posts and heard great things about the new Acura TL, the Infiniti GX 35, the BMW 325ix, and the Saab 9-5.  I think based on the posts I have eliminated the Lexus 330 and the Subie.  I need to drive the car in the winter so I would probably go with a AWD if it is available.  I'll keep piling thru the posts but anyone who has anythoughts please let me know.  Thanks. Cdost1"
1138,pg48477,November 2004,"I don't think there is a question about differences between RWD, FWD and AWD driving dynamics. However there is a fine balance of performance and luxury, specially in this car segment. I think mane people do cross shop all three three of them. One can say ""I got my IS for it's performance and not luxury', but I don't think it would be true statement, because IS is a Lexus and if you buying one you must care a grate deal about luxury.  As for me if TL was RWD I would already be driving one, it does not mean I would not buy one. I like G as well but driving dynamics of RWD and slightly better performance did not win over much better looking TL(in my mind), quality of the interior and slick MT. At the end of the day I do want to enjoy RWD even if i can only do it once a month, but on the other hand I think I will enjoy TL more as my every day car. All I can say I wish I would have money for two cars, but on the other hand I would not buy neither one."
1139,pg48477,November 2004,"If you want MT, try S60R(it starts at 37K and you can get good discounts on Volvo). S60R is way superior than any on your list."

From the information, i can tell why most people would lease a BMW or a MBZ because both company are offering programs to support customers in leasing. I am glad that MBZ offered me 60% residual on my 39months lease term. If i've bought the car and sell it in 3 years, i will get a bigger hit.  I've never heard of any Acura going close to invoice, you must have good negotiation skills to do that. GOOD JOB!!!"
1143,jrock65,November 2004,"I can see why the 325i is so much more popular over the 330i. A well-equipped 325i is $36,000, while the 330i equipped in the exact same way is $42,000. That's an increase of $6000 for some more horses.  The 325i does feel quite underpowered though.  For more horses at that price point and similar features, I guess you could go with the $35,000 G35."
1144,kyfdx,November 2004,"By the time you put everything on the 325i that comes standard on the 330i, the difference is more like $4000.. But, still substantial..  If you can live without some of the extras, of course the difference is $6K... A new '05 325i with no options has an MSRP of $30K."
1145,riez,November 2004,"jrock & kyfdx... It was for those reasons I went with an Lexus IS300 5-speed manual. Cost less than a similarly equipped 325i (IS has better standard equipment) plus better warranty and had some other features I wanted which you can't get on a 325i or 330i (e.g., LSD). The 325i is rather expensive for what you get."
1146,kyfdx,November 2004,"Can't argue with that.. but, almost any new BMW is expensive for what you get.. That is included.. kind of like a ""mandatory"" option.  I like the IS300 and almost bought one... but, I decided to get a slightly used 3-series instead. Since my wife drives it, it really wouldn't have mattered that much.. but, when the blue moon comes around and I get to drive.. I'm glad I did."
1147,fedlawman,November 2004,"Anyone seriously considering a car in this segment cannot make a fully informed decision without at least test-driving the 325i first. It's the benchmark - the 50/50 sport/luxury mix. I believe that to purchase another car in this segment (IS300, G35, etc.) is to basically choose something that is 60/40, 35/75, etc. as compared to the 325i.  BTW, I saw the '05 G35 at the Auto show last weekend and it's the one I'd choose if was shopping this segment today. With 298 HP, 6-speed MT, and nicely-updated interior quality, how can any other $30,000ish car compete?  As for the price difference between the 325i and 330i, I think the 325i is the better choice. You can order it with fewer options, and if you don't think it's quick enough, you can add a Conforti chip and CAI for a few hundred dollars and make it perform within a hair of a 330i.

Equipped in that way, what does the 330i have over the 325i other than horses and different rims?  Maybe I'm missing something."
1150,kyfdx,November 2004,"Leather... in the 330i.. included in premium package.. still $1450 extra in the 325i.. that is the first thing that pops up, but that knocks it down to about $4K..  I might have missed something small other than that.. but, that is the main thing..  EDIT.. also, if you add the sport package, price gets closer by a few more hundred, as the sport suspension is standard in the 330i."
1151,jrock65,November 2004,"Good catch.  Thought leather was part of the premium package for the 325i.  If you include leather, the 325i price becomes $37,370, about $4000 less than the 330i, as you pointed out."

The G is I believe a little nicer inside with more creature comforts in the premium package. tilt and telescoping steering electric is very nice to have. the ease of use of the non-key is great. The wood trim is interesting inside. I am a huge wood guy, but this wood is not as shiny or good looking as others, looks cheap. I hope M does better.     On the tl we are missing a few creature comforts like the electric steering wheel and automatic lights. The tl looks in my opinion nicer on the outside. The tl has again in my opinion the worthless voice activation system which gets the request right about 50 percent of time. All in all these 2 cars are very close. The awd of the g would probably make me buy it if I was in the market at this time. Price however will certainly be higher on the g.                       Bill"

1164,jrock65,November 2004,"All my figures were just MSRP, not saying that anyone pays MSRP for a G35. No one pays MSRP for a 3 series either, at least I hope not.  The discounting makes the G35 even a better deal, since one can generally discount a G35 more off MSRP than a 3 series.  You do get free maintenance and better gas mileage with the 3 (both 3.0 and 2.5), however.  What is the present day worth of the free maintenance anyway?"
1165,blueguydotcom,November 2004,"The discounting makes the G35 even a better deal, since one can generally discount a G35 more off MSRP than a 3 series.   Until November there was a $3k rebate on the 330i, so figuring subtract that from $400 over invoice and you're talking about over 5k off the MSRP sticker on a 330i.

1167,jrock65,November 2004,"I didn't know that you could get $5000 off MSRP on a 330i. That is awesome.  Historically, my impression is that the 3 series was harder to discount than the G35 sedan."
1168,m4d_cow,November 2004,"Historically? nope, theoretically? yes in reality its easier to get 330is for 5k under msrp than getting a 325i for 5k under msrp, due to the fact that 325i sells a whole lot better, and it holds better value when youre reselling it."

For me, it was draggy, bumpy and the steering/handling wasn't at all like the larger models. Just my opinion, I know others love theirs, but if you're looking for a Caddie drive in a less expensive, smaller body, the CTS is a non-starter. I understand they are coming out with a V8 very soon."

Am I making a mountain out of a mole hill or is should this be a concern.  Also I heard from some folks that the TL tends to develop some rattles reasonable quickly after purchase.  Thanks for any counsel."
1172,m4d_cow,November 2004,"rattles: as far as i heard its true w/ the previous TL, but i never heard of such complaint with the new TL  the 325xi might seem a bit underpowered, but its all about your preferences. with G35x you'll get the power but sacrifice the comfort and luxury due to its harsh ride and low quality materials. th TL has both power and comfort for $33k, quite a decent offer. if power is on top of your list, the g is worthy, but if you want luxury along w/ it you might wanna consider the bmw or the TL. hope this helps"
1173,pisciotta,November 2004,I was in the same situation except I was looking at the 330i and TL and I chose the g35X and every day I drive this car it just lets me know I made the right decision the best part of this car is at the bottom of my feet (the pedals) its like an extention of my body it just does what I want it to do!!!!
1174,sevenfeet0,November 2004,"Velostic, with all due respect, you're missing the point of the CTS. This car was never designed to look, drive or handle like the larger models, especially the Deville or the old outgoing Seville. I for one am very happy that this car is nowhere near the handling, road feel or performance or my old Deville.  Also, the CTS already has a V8 model..the hot rod CTS-V. THere is no indication that there will be any other kind of V8 version of this car in non-hot rod form."
1175,cdost1,November 2004,"Thanks for the reply. Right before I saw your response I punched up the 330xi. Looks like that would be a more fair compartor vs the TL and G35x. It looks, though like it will be north of what I am willing to spend.  I am going to go back and drive all 3 again and try to decide.  Thanks for your help."
1176,cdost1,November 2004,Thanks for your response.  I am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the G35x. Would you be able to elaborate a bit ?  This car for me is about being fun to drive. Our other car is a 2004 Acura MDX which acts as family wagon. I need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that I want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well. My boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new.  I have had great luck with 3 Nissan's so just when I was about to eliminate the G35x I decided to keep it in the mix.  Thanks again for your insight
1177,brew99,November 2004,"I went through a similar decision last year and ended up with the TL. Not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the TL handles the white stuff quite well. The car is definitely fun to drive and the AT version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with. I reaaly liked the performance characteristics of the G35 but could not warm up to the interior. The 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me. All 3 are great vehicles however, enjoy the decision making process."
1178,cdost1,November 2004,"Brew,  Thanks much. Just when I think I am leaning in one direction I get a note like yours and I am back to undecided. I think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but I figured I would at least check it out.  As far as the snow goes I am in Northern NJ so some winters are real bad some not so much. Need the FWD or AWD for piece of mind though. I have RWD SUV now and I buying this car because the SUV is a tobaggan in the snow.  One question. I have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the TL at highway speeds 55 - 60 mph. Have you had any experience with this ?  Again thanks for the counsel.  Cdost1"
1179,m4d_cow,November 2004,"""I am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the G35x. Would you be able to elaborate a bit ?""  well, compared to the other 2 the g35 just feels a lot cheaper inside. the plastic feels and looks cheap, and imo the leather seats are overly firm, and many people said the seats hurts their backs on long rides. on the positive side i wont deny that the g is fun to drive, while i'd say the TL is the least fun to drive since it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2."

You can argue with the methodology and results, but them has been the apples for about 15 years in a row or more going back to the 1980s.

Lincoln and Cadillac have also been near the top in these surveys and they've been around a lot longer than the Germans. Lincoln set a new record in the last CSI survey.     Plus, you can get a basic service on a Northstar Cadillac (that's 8 quarts of oil) for $13 at my dealership. The latte and muffins better be pretty darn good to make up for that."
1188,maxhonda99,December 2004,It's not necessarily true that all Lexus dealers were built from scratch when Lexus started in late 1989. I know several NJ area Lexus dealers that started in buildings that previously sold & serviced other brands. One Lexus dealer that opened in 4th qtr. '89 was a Volvo dealer before.
1189,riez,December 2004,"eaton53... Would be interesting to compare market share, sales, reliability and customer satisfaction date for both Cadillac and Lincoln in 1985 (before A, I, & L) and then in the post-A-I-L era (i.e., say 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2004). C & L, like A, BMW, & MB learned some hard lessons.     maxhonda99... Did they renovate the building significantly? A, I, & L had completely new franchise agreements when they came on line. And they deliberately started off with small networks in an attempt to better ""manage"" customer service issues vis-a-vis dealers."

Denville dealer is nice, just won't go down on their prices.     Have you considered the FX by infiniti? That's really nice, and you might be able to scoop up a really good deal on a 2004.

1197,dartman3,December 2004,"In addition to the quote, if you got one, please share your opinion on the 325ix vs. G35x in their performance and drivability. I just drove the 325ix. Haven't driven the Infiniti yet."
1198,darrenw,December 2004,"hi cdost, cargal and everyone,     I'm currently looking for a new car. I have the 300C, 3's, G35, ES and TL in my list.  300C is off the list because I wasnt impressed by it's handling, front grill and interior, but boy the car was really flying. I guess its time to move up to a real entry luxury performance class     Test drove the ES, everything is perfect except for acceleration, speed and handling. And I guess this one is also off my list.     Now I'm leaning towards the last 3 cars. I would have taken the TL off my list after reading some comments, but I decided not to (not yet).  I havent test driven the car, no so crazy about it. Too many of them on the street.     Having said that, I did some research on the new TL on all car related websites, NHTSA and many others. I'm quite surprised that ES'04 has more trans failures than all those 3's, followed by 3's, G35  and TL'04. (I couldnt find any about trans failure on TL'04, is this for real?  but more on BMW3'04, G35'04 and especially the ES'04)     I'm going to test drive the G35 this afternoon and 330/325 later on. I'm hoping that G35 is the one. I love that sexy looking car.     One question though, I read some post that the G35X is not as fast as the G35 and I also heard the 6MT has problems with it's transmission. According to some, Infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain.  Is there any other things that I should look at (I understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but I can live with that)?     Thanks, darren"
1199,m4d_cow,December 2004,"Trans failure was common on TL's pre 04 models, but i rarely heard of such problem happening to newer models.  while imo the TL is the fastest, it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2, particularly the torque steer and (sometimes) floaty ride at high speeds.     The gx is slower, true, and somehow its handling isnt as impressive as the rwd model as well. i never drove the 6mt so i cant say anything about it. also, if ride-comfort is on your list you really should try before buying, since many people (including me) think the rides harsh and uncomfy on longer rides. one more thing, try the seats for a while to make sure youre comfortable w/ it, the seats controls are awkwardly placed and might hurt you on longer rides.     3ers are ok, quite underpowered and overpriced though. i say comfort is better than the g but still second to the TL. oh and prepare yourself for minor electrical problems (common w/ any bmw models)     hope it helps, goodluck"

Plus it hasn't gotten tired... sales have increased every year since it came out."
1208,indydriver,January 2005,"I looked at all the Caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed. First thing is the $42,000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle. Then you have to look at it. 300C beats Caddy at their own game for $5-$7K less. And if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux, all three Japanese premium brands had superior styling, quality, content and value. Euros have the hardware if you want to pay a $5-$10k premium. What is even more surprising is looking down market for a mainstream 4-door sedan. It is incredible how out-to-lunch the domestics are. Ford 500? Are you kidding me?"
1209,eaton53,January 2005,"""First thing is the $42,000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle.""     Very high end of the scale there. Most CTS aren't anywhere near that much. And there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedans not to beat them up.     It's also a bigger car... many people also appreciate the space it offers.     The 3.6 is underpowered only in some alternate universe. 255 hp and 252 lb/ft of torque on regular gas.     ""Then you have to look at it. 300C beats Caddy at their own game for $5-$7K less.""     Have you driven one? I have. The 300C is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle. Fast in a straight line, sure. But throw in some corners and there's lots of body roll and tire squeal. Caddys don't do any of that.     300C lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan.... it's a fast cruiser.     ""And if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux, all three Japanese premium brands had superior styling""     In your opinion. IMO, except for the G35 they're bland, too small or have wrong wheel drive.      ""quality,""     Cadillac is one of only 3 manufacturers in the top 5 of all 3 Power surveys. Only one of the others is Japanese. Sorry, but the surveys don't back up these superior quality claims.     ""content and value.""     They're all loaded and cost similar amounts... nothing there.     ""Euros have the hardware if you want to pay a $5-$10k premium.""     For a less reliable product."
1210,qbrozen,January 2005,"Not that I like getting caught up in the useless sales numbers, but I had to ask why there is a discrepancy between shapiro's numbers and danny's numbers.     If I add up all of danny's 3-series numbers, I get less than 69K (i didn't do exact, just a rough add-up in my head), but shap's obviously shows almost 40k more than that. What's missing? Coupes and convertibles? Did they really sell almost 40k coupes and convertibles? That's a huge number for niche styles like that."

1214,qbrozen,January 2005,"oops. yer right. it was right there in the title of the post: ""no wagons.""     Yeah, the ES looks to be popular, but the IS and GS numbers are downright pitiful."
1215,riez,January 2005,"qbrozen... Can't say I agree with your statement: ""Yeah, the ES looks to be popular, but the IS and GS numbers are downright pitiful.""     I would agree that Lexus should be ashamed of how little they advertise/market both the IS and GS. Given that Lexus does next to nothing to promote either and that BOTH are in the last MY of their current platform, I'd say sales are absolutely amazingly good!     IS300 sedan holding up compared to BMW 330i sedan.     And the GS competes against a different class of cars: E-class, A6, and 5 Series.     If you add up all the Lexus sedan sales--ES, GS, and IS--Lexus dealers are happy. Plus about 50% of all Lexus sales are SUVs. SUVs are where Lexus' action has been for about 5 years now."
1216,qbrozen,January 2005,"Well, comparing JUST the 330i to the IS300 is not quite kosher. Just because Lexus doesn't offer 2 engine choices in their car or the option of AWD does not justify limiting 3-series sales to one option.     Less than 7K cars is quite pitiful, IMHO. Toyota decided to kill the Celica after it sold more than double that number in 2003. So why kill a car with 15k sales and keep one with 7k?     I'm not arguing as to WHY it suffers in sales, just that it does."
1217,dhanley,January 2005,"""I looked at all the Caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed.""     Hm. I drove the CTS at gm's autoshow in motion back to back with the TL. I think the only way the TL was better is that its interior quality was somewhat better. Aside from that, the CTS handled better, was more spacious, and the engine felt better ( quieter, smoother, less peaky ).     The CTS stickers for a smidge less than the TL and you can surely get a bigger discount on it."
1218,qbrozen,January 2005,"unfortunately, that ""smidge"" cheaper CTS is lacking in content compared to the TL. Add in the $8K 1SC package and you've just blown the TL's price out of the water."
1219,eaton53,January 2005,"You can get a CTS anyway you want it. If you want to pay more, you can. If you want it stripped, you can get that, too. Two different engines, auto or manual with either one.... and they all drive the rear wheels.     Just because ""you"" want that stuff, doesn't mean everyone does."
1220,qbrozen,January 2005,"yeah, that's great. but you really daned around that one. Were you really trying to prove that a heavily modified vehicle is better than a TL? Hey, congrats on that win, bud!     did you forget the title of the topic? Apparently you did. How bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself. The CTS-V, modified or not, is NOT an entry level luxo sports sedan. And, once again, NOTHING in this class is a supercar. Can it be made to perform like one with enough money? Of course. I can make a toaster beat the heck out of an M3 with enough money. But neither would fall into this category."
1221,eaton53,January 2005,"""How bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself. The CTS-V, modified or not, is NOT an entry level luxo sports sedan.""     Just looked... and now you're telling me a CTS-V is not a CTS. Now that's absurd!! I suppose a 330i is also not a 3-Series? Different motor, sports packages are there also.     The barrier here has been price, but I've also shown how to get a CTS-V for less than many of the cars in this topic, even provided the link, so that's out the window. But hey, when you can't compete, you deny and say it doesn't fall into the category. Utter nonsense.     ""Can it be made to perform like one with enough money? I can make a toaster beat the heck out of an M3 with enough money. But neither would fall into this category.""     Again, at the top of this category it says ""CTS"". The CTS-V is a CTS. You can get one for less than $40K. And to top it off, now you claim you can make a toaster perform like one with enough money, yet you produced neither the toaster, or the mythical car.     Fish or cut bait... where's the CAR?"
1222,fedlawman,January 2005,"""Did they let them drive those cars home?""     ""Where's the CAR?""     Quote from a website that townhall rules prohibit me from linking -     ""The team had only ninety days to prepare a stock TL to NASA Honda Challenge specifications. While the engine, drivetrain and brake system remained stock, the team augmented the TL's 3.2 liter V6 with a cold air intake, and a custom exhaust header from Prototype Racing. A large diameter exhaust, a lightweight flywheel and a performance clutch were provided by Comptech USA. The suspension was modified with custom H&R coil-overs, a Progress adjustable rear sway bar and adjustable SPC camber ball joints and links. Lightweight Enkei racing wheels and Toyo RA-1 race compound tires were used for increased grip...""     That's a FWD luxury sedan with stock engine, drivetrain and brakes - and it finished 3rd in a 25-hour endurance race against Porsche's, BMW's, and Cobra's.     ""The CTS-V is #1 at both Road & Track and Automobile.""     So what's that got to do with the $33,000 CTS (3.6L) we're talking about in this forum? The Saleen Cobra is an awesome car, but does that make the V-6 Mustang your sister drives a top-notch sport coupe?     Seriously, let's just leave the CTS-V (and that ridiculous, $120,000 Mallet) out of this discussion, OK?     In my opinion, the TL is a fine choice in this segment for someone who wants solid 8/10ths handling, a great engine/powertrain, and top quality materials and amenities. The CTS (again in my opinion) may offer 9/10ths handling, but in a package that is larger (it has the wheelbase of a Range Rover!), short on amenities, and has sub-par material quality and polarizing styling.     The bottom line is - both the Acura TL and Cadillac CTS are fine $33,000 choices. The ""better"" car is simply the one that possesses the characteristics that each of us value on an individual basis.     To dismiss the TL because of it's FWD layout is just as absurd as dismissing the CTS because of it's unconventioanl styling. If it's not your cup of tea, fine, but that doesn't make it inferior."

Kinda like comparing the Chevy Monte Carlo with its NASCAR 4th-cousin twice removed raced on Sunday's!!     Back to reality... the TL is certainly competitive to the G, 3-Series, CTS, etc... it just offers it's own distinct interpretation of the automotive experience to suit drivers that find those characteristics to be valuable.

Issues like Styling, I-Drive, reliability and competition, namely G35 and CTS(price?)was discussed in this article. I guess bimmer fans, and passive fans like myself and of course detractors have always known this to be the case, (we've certainly debated those same issues in these forums quite a bit).      I certainly did not get the impression the article was mean to inflame. It pointed out Bmw sales were up world-wide. And in 2003 it made $3.5billion in profit, more than GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Renault combined. However it's U.S market share had dropped due to these same issues and also changing demographics.     While I am passively in the market(I just paid off my 2000 Mazda Millennia S)If I decide to pull the trigger, M35sport, G35, TL and Jaguar would be my order of preference.

That is also one thing that turned me off when I test-drove a Saab 9-3 before deciding on the 325. The instrument panel of the Saab was very complex-looking -- dozens of buttons -- and with the display for the radio and that other display up under the windshield, it definitely didn't do it for me.

The G is too small, 325 is too small, the A4 is too small, the 9-3 has gotten terrible reviews.     It appears that the CTS is just as big as the TL. I understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the CTS. I like the exterior styling of the CTS. One problem is that the Acura dealer is 60 miles away and the Cadillac dealer is 2 miles away. That is a big deal to me. I also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the CTS, a car i would of never looked at a year ago.     It really is tough. On paper the Acura wins and on the interior the Acura wins. I prefer the Caddy exterior to the TL exterior.     The Acura is cheaper on MSRP as well, but I am wondering if the street price of the CTS is probably much less than the MSRP. It has to be. So, a $38k CTS probably costs you $32k or so is what I am thinking. Does anyone here know?     I am looking to lease, not buy so that changes things a little bit."
1239,kyfdx,January 2005,"1) If you like the CTS exterior, that counts for something..     2) 2 miles vs. 60 miles to the dealer is another real benefit..     3) The lease deals on TLs right now are just standard rates.. no manufacturer support..

The performance of the Legacy GT is equal or better. Safety measures & crash tests findings are equal.

Electronic tilt-telescope (if it were bmw I'd expect that would break after 2-3 years). Seats are wide, la-z-boy like. Shifter feels smoother and shorter than that 2003 manual I drove. Engine's got crazy power - pulls like a damn rocket sled. Car still feels lumbering and not very agile even with optional 18s. you sit far too high up so the feeling of speed is more apparent than in the bmw and it ends up making the car feel more like a souped up, decent handling buick with that big interior and so much metal everywhere. fun car for 32k or so. But still think I'd opt for a used bimmer before getting a G35. It still doesn't feel like a legit sport sedan. More a fast sporty sedan. And that engine, while powerful just is too rough when pushed. It sounds like it might break above 5k rpm. No redline on the tach but an annoying light starts to blink at 3500-4k telling me to shift.

Don&#146;t forget, half of the sport sedan is &#147;sedan&#148;.(/i)  Here's my take on the 2005 Legacy GT. blueguydotcom, ""AWD MT Sedans - Subaru Legacy GT vs Others"" #35, 1 Mar 2005 12:02 pm  It got yanked yesterday because I used an acronym that is looked down upon here.  As for the S2000, intriguing but not really worth it as the performance from that engine is only marginally better than my 330i perf pack. And the car's not really useful/ Boxster - not to my liking in any way, shape or form - basically it's just heinous. 911's sweet but not my bag either. Too much like a middle aged man's Vette in my eyes. Pretty impractical too.  If I were to get a modder beater, it'd be a miata and then I'd turbo it.  Hey, see the new IS? Bland (but styling's pretty unimportant to me) but the possibility of the 3.5 with 300 hp, RWD, lower driving position and lexus reliability, gets my eyebrows up. I'm hoping I've finally found something that can at least run with my E46 and not make pine for it."
1256,blueguydotcom,March 2005,"Chris, nice to see you. And no I don't hate the G35. Far from it. Excellent car that isn't quite there.  Regarding seating, lowering the seat would only make me like I'm sitting in a hole and it won't change the fact the car is so damn high.  As for handling - please tell me you'll drive the sport model next time. No one complains in fact the 03 had .9 skidpad and 67 slalom (or 66.5 maybe can't remember) - not exactly lumbering.  Drove a G35 manual 05 which comes with the 18s. AFAIK, the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically. If i'm wrong, please correct me. I believe I'm right though (remember I wanted to buy an 03).  For a car the runs with - and not behind the 3 with ZHP pack - sporty sedan is just plain WRONG. You must have been owned by a G some time ago and have a bad thing for them now. You've been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least.  Owned how? I don't race people. I was owned by a G35 03 on a test drive - the car lifted up in the rear on a turn. Unsettling to say the least. IMHO, and it's just my opinion (thought other seem to agree), the G35 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp. Trust me, I wanted to buy an 03 and I desperately wanted to love the 05 G35. But the car's handling and engine just didn't match my expectations for a car in this class. I would love to be in a reliable, fast, competent, japanese sports sedan (not to mention cheap!). But I can't find one!"
1257,blueguydotcom,March 2005,"And the 06 330 swill seem sluggish compared to a 298hp G for sure. And that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 has..with more legroom.  Uh, I haven't touched the 06 3 so I won't comment on the performance. Though I will say I think the body is ugly, interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted. The e46 was already too porky (not just in weight but also size), so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but I have very low expectations for the car. And for BMW in general.  BTW, my 330i with its measely 235 hp, still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 G35. The inline 6 in my ZHP may not be my favorite engine but god, it's so smooth it makes me wonder how Subaru and Infiniti even try to compete with those engines. The racket in the highend is insane."
1258,blueguydotcom,March 2005,"Actually, the 06 IS300 (with 252) is on my shortlist. I don't care for the exterior or interior but it may have the traits I desire - great handling, RWD (not a fan or AWD or FWD), low seating position (no matter how low you make the seat in a G the car still rides high), bulletproof reliability and of course a decent price.  I'm anything but brand loyal. The guys at bimmerfest will atest to how I go rounds regarding my 330i and lousy bmw buid quality."
1259,vanhalenabe,March 2005,"** Also posted this on the Infiniti G35 Sedan and FX35 boards**  Hi everyone, this is my first post on this board. To give you a little background, I currently own a Mazda MX-6 and my wife drives an Acura MDX. We have a 14 month baby girl, and it is getting very difficult for me to get her in and out of the car seat, if I have to pick her up.  So, I'm in the market for a new vehicle. I had wanted to stay with a manual transmission -- I don't have traffic in my commute and prefer the fun and feel of a manual transmission.  Anyway, I had narrowed the choice down to the Acura TL 6MT and the Infiniti G35 Sedan with 6MT. After weighing all of the pros and cons, I decided to go with the G35.  Then came the baby car seat test, in which the G35 did not do well. The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions. The G35 does not have this.  I then tried to put the rear-facing car seat behind the drivers seat and the passengers seat. Even with the seats adjusted to my short 5'8"" frame, I found that I had to move the seats too far forward in the G35. The Acura was a tiny bit better in this regard. Since my heart was set on the G35, I was very disappointed in this.  We only have one child now, but hope to have a second one in the future. Meaning that we will probably have both a forward facing toddler seat and a rear facing infant seat in the back. So, I really need a vehicle that can accomodate both.  This brings me to small SUV's. I test drove both the Infiniti FX35 and the Lexus RX330. The Lexus is more practical, but I really prefer the looks and sporty feel of the FX35. I preferred the control and feel of the FX35 sport suspension, with the 20"" wheels, even though the ride was a tad harsher. I live in Dallas, and a RWD car with big wheels will rarely have weather issues to contend with.  I would appreciate any advice, especially with regards to the baby car seats, that would help me make my decision. If there are any parents of young children out there that have faced a similar problem recently, I would appreciate your input.  I have checked out the Infiniti Snugkids website, but it does not say anything about how to put a car seat in the center position.  One thought is to go with the my first choice, the G35. The problems with the infant car seat will only be for the first couple of years. After which the baby will be in a forward-facing car seat that the G35 can easily accomodate. Do I rule out my #1 choice just because of a car seat? Like I said, I was very disappointed when the G35 did not do well with the car seats. I'm beginning to think that all mid-size sedans will have this problem.  Sorry for the long email. Thanks."

Hmmm, that smacks of an ""Urban Legend"" as it has been repeated so often that most folks believe it without thinking about it. As a counterpoint to that statement, I have leased two BMWs, and in both cases I was quoted a lower monthly lease price from an non BMW-FS leasing outfit. The only reason I lease my second BMW through BMW-FS is because I did the European Delivery thing, and it was just easier to arrange.  As for: ""...and (2) very high residuals."", I'm thinking that that statement is the truth of the matter.  Best Regards, Shipo"
1266,billyperks,March 2005,"The last car I leased was a Mazda Millennia and I enjoyed every bit of it.

I am just going to play the waitng game to see all the new goodies and upgrades next year."
1267,blueguydotcom,March 2005,I'm pretty happy with my 330i lease. I pay 485 a month on a car with an msrp of 43k. 15k miles/3 years. Shrug.

1270,blueguydotcom,March 2005,I got the MSDs - which I get back at the end. So in terms of cash that is gone forever from my pocket I think it was something like $750 or $1000. But that was titling and the first month's payment too.  When I figured out the dollars I will be out to BMW in May of 06 it was 18k total. 6k a year to play with a car isn't bad.  The residual on the car is 25k (59% residual)...as if it will be worth THAT much in 06. My MF factor was like 0.0007.
1271,jrock65,March 2005,"The following is from a Lexus dealer rep who's been reliable in the past.  In October 2005: '06 IS250 and IS350. The IS250 will have a 6 speed manual tranny OR a automatic V6 engine. The IS250 will have 220 horsepower. The IS350 is a V6 automatic ONLY, but will have guarranteed minimum of 325 horsies. The IS350 will have an available ""Sport Package"" with ""18 wheels. Pricing will remain competitive and the IS will start around $32k-$33k, same as what we have now, but a top of the line will be about $45k.  In March 2006: '07 ES350 will have a 3.5 liter engine with a completely new body style. The only thing they are keeping the same on the ES will be the headlight design.  In April 2006: '07 RX350 will have the same updated engine as the ES  In May 2006: GS450Hybrid will have a V6 hybrid engine, but be faster than the GS430.  In September 2006: LS460Hybrid with 2 body styles, one 6 inches longer, will be added to the regular LS. Both will have 4.6 V8 engines.  In September 2006: '07GS350 will have the updated engine, but same body style.  In September 2006: '07 GS460 will have an updated engine.  In 2-3 more years the IS convertible with retractable hard top is coming for cetain. And other car ideas that are being tossed around also are the ""Super LS"" that will cost more than $100k and the ""SuperCoupe"" that will go 200 MPH.  ------------------  Also, it seems that Toyota is going to use the 3.5 GR V6 in much the same fashion that Nissan uses the 3.5 VQ V6, meaning that a lot Toyotas/Lexuses will have it. No doubt the next Camry, Solara, Sienna, and Highlander will carry the 3.5 GR as well."

And this strategy worked because I bought an I35 and many dealers are looking to get rid of their leftover cars from last year."

1290,blueguydotcom,March 2005,"Johnny,  I love the TSX. I can't quite explain its appeal. I love the clean style, the nice, simple, legant cockpit but more importantly, I go ga-ga for the silky smoth 6 speed in those things. Like buddah. I've driven them a few times and I always dug the eager pull of the engine, the delight of keeping the car over 4k rpm with plenty of room to play.  The 330i is a pretty different beast. The driving dynamics matched with the power won me over. If you feel like your TSX just isn't there for power, and if you'd like that special punch in corners of RWD then you'll enjoy the 330i. Really, the only way you'll know, go drive one. And let the salesguy know it's all about the handling. In other words don't let him take you on some anemic on surface street, then the freeway and back test drive. You want twists, turns, hills, switchbacks and plenty of opp to flog the car as god intended.  Yes, BMWs on the west coast are everywhere! you can't swing a dead cat in any west coast major city without hitting a bimmer. Unfortunate but true - one my reason the TSX attracts me.  If I hadn't run across a 330i with manual to drive in 03, I'm sure I woulda ended up in a TSX. I woulda been fairly happy too. Just yearned for more power and AWD/RWD.  Knowing what I know now about my 330i would I lease again...hmmm. Most likely yes but I gotta say I'd dwell on it way more. I would probably still lease. I really wish I could own a BMW, but I simply don't think they're good cars. All this talk about the 08 M3 4 door has me excited and conflicted. You just can't lease an M3, it's a car you buy and keep. And the idea of buying a BMW troubles me. The idea of owning a lexus, infiniti, mazda, acura doesn't raise my eyebrow in the least."
1291,gordonwd,March 2005,"Autoweek had a preview article this week on the new IS350, and compared it to the '06 330i (E90). They thought that the IS350's styling beat that of the E90 (they said it ""pops"" while the 330i merely ""pings"", or something like that). They also estimated a 0-60 time beating the 330i by a full second since the IS350 will have 300hp under the hood.  In summary, they really liked this car, and it will be interesting when they get around to actually testing and comparing both in U.S. spec form."

You can bet it will be low slung the way a sport sedan should be. However, if the engine goes up front it may run into a problem…  I think one of the problems is the new pedestrian safety regs which, among other things, require a certain amount of clearance between the hood and the engine. When the hood height gets raised, so does the rest of the car which may account for the slab-sidedness we&#146;ve been seeing. It certainly appears as if the E90 and new IS conform to these regs, in addition to the other new generations."

1301,buddhabman,April 2005,designman - In terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the BMW 330i. Driving the old gen Legacy on twisty mountain roads was pure fun. The new Legacy GT with power can hold it's own with any of the cars in this segment. It's known for having one of the most stable driving feel on bumpy roads.
1302,designman,April 2005,"Bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water, so if a Legacy GT is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension&#151;ability to absorb shock. I will agree to disagree with you on this and I find that the reviews overrated it considerably."

My 330 was great in that environment. Does it have a soft suspension?  I haven't test driven the Legacy, but test drove the Forester and Outback. Maybe they aren't up to BMW standards, but for many $$$ less they are darn close."

1307,designman,April 2005,"Doesn&#146;t matter where you drive, the Legacy GT handles like a boat whether it&#146;s the Atlantic or Indian Ocean. Outback has a much tighter suspension. Forget about the Forester, it's not even on the map in the handling category. Leads me to believe that, like the Legacy, you haven't driven it."
1308,kdshapiro,April 2005,"Hmm. You may be right about the Legacy, I don't think I drove it, I drove the Outback, my impression was it was more trucky like. (I've driven so many they all blend in). But, surely the Forester XT will not outhandle a sedan. But for what it is, silky smooth shifter, power galore with the turbo, taut suspension, spacious cross-over, 5.3 to 60, LSD and $$$ less than an X3, it's a perfect vehicle for some. Heck, it'll blow past an FX45. Can you tell I had a blast driving it? The cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money. Although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment, as the amenities are not up to others in the segment, it's a lot of bang for the buck.  And finally for those who dwell on such things, it's reliable and it got the IIHS best pick. Comparing it against a 330, no it's not all that, but you know what it's $15K less. And Subaru scrimped in the amenities, not the engine, handling or drivetrain."
1309,jcj1,April 2005,"I need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days. I have narrowed the field down to two: an Infiniti G35 RWD Sedan or a Subaru Legacy GT LTD Wagon. I can get either car for $500 over invoice via the Costco program, and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options I want.  For the G35, I opt for RWD because I live in the California where there is no real need for AWD. I'd go with the AT because I feel the G35 accelarate more smoothly with the AT, while the 6MT is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute.  For the Subaru, I opt for the Wagon because I love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice (my personal opinion). Unfortunately the AT does not work well with the 2.5 Turbo in the Subaru, and the 5MT with STi short throw shifter and Momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a Mazda Miata. So I think I'd go with the MT for the Subaru.  Now the questions:  1) My wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time (We kept our last two cars for 10-15 years). Is this a good enough reason to stay away from the Subaru?  2) How is the predicted reliability of Subaru compared to Infiniti? This is our No. 1 priority. So far we only have experience with Honda and Toyota which have been pretty much trouble free. Can I expect the same level of quality and reliability from Subaru or Infiniti/Nissan?  3) Is $500 over invoice a good price for these cars? Is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than Costco's?  Your help is most appreciated. Thanks!"
1310,kdshapiro,April 2005,"Some thoughts:  1. cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without. In 15 years, who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is? But in 15 years, what will be the reliability of the G35?  2. You can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports. You can read the Subaru and Infiniti forums for some insight as to the types of issues people are experiencing.  3. I would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up, rather than to work my way down.  Good luck"
1311,gordonwd,April 2005,"In 7 years of ownership, the only major out-of-pocket expense on my A4 1.8T was a turbo-related repair that cost me about $600. So take that for what it's worth. But it is one reason why I downgraded the Saab 9-3 as a replacement for the A4: I just didn't want another turbo for long-term ownership (ended up with a 325i). Look under the hood and you'll see a lot of extra plumbing, sensors, controls, etc. that are related to the turbo. And the thought of something in there spinning at 20K RPM for years and years makes me cringe ."
1312,shipo,April 2005,"Back in the 1980s when Chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world, I had not one but two of their cars. Both were running strong at 100,000 miles when I traded them in, and I had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had I decided to keep them. Having said that, within my immediate sphere of family and friends, there were five other Mopar turbos that I was aware of, and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75,000 miles (one needed two turbo replacements). The only difference that I could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan, I used Mobil-1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use.  I switched to Mobil-1 from Castrol-GTX when I got my first turbo simply because I'd heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hot/high speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown. I reasoned that the Synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking, and while my sampling of two isn't definitive, it was enough to cause me to use nothing but Mobil-1 in every car I've had since then.  Best Regards, Shipo"
1313,gordonwd,April 2005,"And on my A4 turbo they had a recommended oil-change interval of 5000 miles vs. 7500 miles for the 3.0 V6 model of the same car. Even with that, I heard that there were some issues with engine problems caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used. I got a letter from Audi regarding this a few months after I had sold the car. Fortunately, I sold it to a friend of mine down the street, so was able to pass on the warning to him."
1314,squirtdad,April 2005,"I havn't seen much input on the small mecedes sedan, the c230 (supercharged, etc)  Does any on have any input on this one, especially compared to bmw 325 and Audi A4  thanks"
1315,potemkin,April 2005,"Here's my two cents: I test drove two '05 C230's back in November. One was a sport coupe with an automatic. The other was a sport sedan w/6 speed manual. I drove the auto first* and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off. The 6 speed, on the other hand, had no noticeable lag and I couldn't tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six. As far as the shifter goes, it was silky smooth, quick and short. The road holding was good, but a little softer than I'm used to (though not as soft as MB's reputation for a soft ride).  * I had no intention of buy an automatic, it's just that they didn't have any sticks on the lot when I went looking.  You're welcome.  P.S.: For what it's worth, I wound up buying a '05 325i ZSP in January. Never drove the A4 -- I have an aversion to FWD."
1316,twodogjohnny,April 2005,"I just sold my 04 WRX, and got an 05 G35X. The WRX is something like 227hp, the legacy is 250hp with half a litre more displacement. 4cyl vs. 6cyl: you are going to be reving that subaru above 3k to keep it in the powerband. The low end is real hard to find with the subaru. The subaru manual transmission is like shifting a tractor.  I always felt like I was racing and working hard while driving the WRX. I just push the pedal and cruise along with the G35. Power is always there when you need it.  -johni"
1317,kdshapiro,April 2005,I understand and am not debating that point. I was only pointing out that after a test drive or two I understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars. They are not entry level luxos. But the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.  The Forester for example was clocked at 5.3 to 60 by C&D with only 210 hp. Like the Bimmers these cars are sleepers. But again I realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins.
1318,gordonwd,April 2005,"That's the ""problem"" with getting into the luxury segment: you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didn't know about them . Two cars ago I owned a Sentra SE-R that I thought was a really great car -- sort of the early 90's equivalent to the WRX in being a pocket-rocket, sleeper type of compact car. When I got my A4, I suddenly woke up to all the features that I didn't have in the Sentra: power windows, climate control, great stereo, and on and on.  Now I don't think I can go back to what now seems like a stripped-down car like the Sentra, and in retrospect even my A4 seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i (how did I ever get along without memory power seats?? ). And I just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment, and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel, if you can believe that!"
1319,kdshapiro,April 2005,"I agree 98%. After living with a 3 series for a few years, I got very spoiled. I like the extra luxo stuff, no doubt. However, I realized the loaded Outback would be quite acceptable to me as would the Forester XT premium. I do want the power this, power that, heated this and automatic that and leather.  I found out don't *need* a premium brand and I can gracefully step down the luxo factor, and still like the car.  With the additional requirement for more cars in the family I'm thinking through the difference between what is wanted and what is needed."
1320,ljwalters1,May 2005,"I appreciate your assessment. I have a TL and didn't bother looking at the BMWs b/c I needed a larger car, too. It would've had to be a 5-series, and there's no way I could afford it.  Anyway, I love my '04 6MT TL w/Nav, and don't understand other posters' comments re turns. The TL handles great - nice and tight, yet very comfortable. The only negative is torque steer. In fact, while I'm sure BMW are faster, my TL gives me more power than I can use. Great acceleration, great handling, great features, etc. Only problem is the torque steer."
1321,realty_pro,May 2005,"I test drove the 05TL, 05 G35 and 05 3 series. I totally disagree with the aforementioned assessment, as I opted for the G35 sedan. I added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series' league. The RWD drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the TL. In addition, the TL & 3 series doesn't have the ""umfff"" factor that the G has. The power and acceleration is head snapping. Infiniti put there dollars into the performance..."
1322,byronwalter,May 2005,"...it is a very good value and I felt that it would make an excellent high-speed cruiser. But the car just didn't feel good or dialed in when going through curves... at least as compared to the 330i I drove or even my under-powered Audi A4 with the itty-bitty 1.8 turbo (Quattro). I admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that I have read in car mags indicate that the TL does generate good handling numbers. But the communication just doesn't seem to be there. The TL I drove really didn't like fast, tight turns. Might just have been that the tires weren't at a proper pressure. But can't argue with the TL pricing... the car is a nice deal, especially compared to the 330i. But between the two I'd shell out the extra $$$ for the bimmer (but I guess I better give the G35 a look).  Byron"
1323,djocks,May 2005,"I would look at the 5 series more also if it were not out of my budget.  I am going to drive the TL again on Tuesday but the first time I thought it drove very nice. The acceleration was, as you said, all I would ever need and the creature comforts and toys on the inside are absolutely second to none. Torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in CT and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference.  I can not get over how BMW improved so much on what was already the best driving experience in the class. I am also looking hard into an x3. I just wish I liked the look more.  djocks  Anyway, I will keep you posted"
1324,ljwalters1,May 2005,"""it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference""  That's been my experience.  Regarding the looks of the BMW, I decided awhile ago the exterior looks of a vehicle is tertiary (even less important than secondary!!!!). Yes, it can provide an ""Ooohh"" factor with the valet, but if the interior is nice and the drive is good, that's all I care about."
1325,aaargh,May 2005,"When it comes right down to it, the choice between the TL, BMW, and G35 is about what is important to you.  If performance is what is most important to you, the BMW or G35 is the way to go. They both excel (excuse the pun) in the performance department. But, IMHO, they are a little shy in the size, comfort, and luxury area.  If you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the TL is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped BMW and G35.  I test-drove all 3 (&#145;05 BMW, not &#146;06). I bought and am very happy with my TL."
1326,ljwalters1,May 2005,Good assessment. Reminds me of a post I read where someone called the TL a sporty luxury car and the G35 a sports car with some luxury features.
1327,esfoad,May 2005,"Hi guys, jumping in a little late here in this discussion, but I also test drove all the above in addition to the Avalon and the Maxima. I eneded up with the G35X for a couple of reasons. IMHO it handles as well as the BMW, the brakes were a little better than the BMW. The Acura is a really nice piece but I felt cramped in it. I'm 6'-1"" and around 265lbs. Also the back seat of the TL seamed smaller than the G35X's. I believe that any of the cars you are looking at will make you smile. It's a tribute to the manufacturers that we are having this discussion. Enjoy whichever one you choose and good luck with her."
1328,laurasdada,May 2005,"So, you really don't like the Lexus ES huh?  They are all very good cars. The one you buy, is of course, the best. I bought my '05 TL over the G35x for the smoother, quieter ride and (IMHO) superior exterior/interior style and interior materials."
1329,frisconick,May 2005,"Consumer Reports and Car and Driver, both tested these cars and the TL was the fastest, even faster than the G35 coupe. Only the BMW M3 was faster than the TL for about 10,000 more. The BMW has slightly better road feel, but the TL handles great around tight turns. I think some of you people are just in love with BMW label. The TL is the best value and a great car. :P"
1330,kdshapiro,May 2005,"Unfortunately CRs testing is not duplicated in the real world. While it's true the TL did post good numbers in the slalom, the 3 series beat the TL by a big margin in emergency handling and other manuevers  So if you want to drive around slaloms in your daily commute and if you want the toys and don't mind torque steer get the TL. If you want a drivers car get the 3 or G35."
1331,frisconick,May 2005,"Yes the BMW does handle better but CR rated the TL handling as excellent, but I disagre, the TL is a drivers car. Additionally the G35 fish tails unexpectadly. They also said the 2005 TL is ""deviod of torque steer"" I test drove a 330i, plus the G35 Coupe and they didn't feel faster than the TL to me. In fact the TL, as reported again by CR was faster in:  0 - 30 0 - 60 quarter mile"
1332,frisconick,May 2005,"BMW M3 333hp 55.5mph Acura TL 270hp 52.5mph  This makes the TL very competitive with BMW re cornering. However CR did say the TL is not ""as nimble as the BMW or the Mercedes C class"", but it's not bad."
1333,lmacmil,May 2005,""" The one you buy, is of course, the best.""  And I will add ""for your particular needs.""  It's silly to argue one choice over another based on a magazine review. The magazine reviewers have different sets of criteria. CR is biased towards overall functionality. They view the car as a transportation appliance. The enthusiast magazines are looking primarily at overall performance. Since most of us don't have California's exciting canyon roads to traverse, that last little bit of handling prowess that the BMW may provide over the FWD TL isn't a meaningful differentiator.  I find the R&T and C&D reviews a little more helpful since they come up with a numeric score. That allows the reader to weigh his/her criteria differently and possibly arrive at a different conclusion.  As has been pointed out many times, these (G, TL, 3) are all very good cars and most of us would be happy with any one of them. Ultimately, it's probably going to be something subjective (e.g., interior quality, exterior appearance) that sways us to one over another."
1334,frisconick,May 2005,"Excellent post! CR does push the cars for performance and CR does not accept advertising so I believe they are more objective. They also give scores based on many criteria. I was just responding to people who claim the TL is a slow, ponderous, car. When in fact it's faster than most BMWs and corners almost as good."

1337,frisconick,May 2005,"Horse hockey! lol  I bought a TL for my wife so it had to be an automatic so I have not driven a TL MT. I will check it out for myself this weekend. I am now in the market for a car for myself, so this forum is really helping out, thanks all.  However, when professional drivers, who work for a non-profit organization, who spend hours testing a car, tells me there is no torque steer, I believe them. But, Shipo, if you and your friends found it did have torque steer, I will be on alert, thanks. I just something else :shades:"
1338,frisconick,May 2005,I just might buy something else.
1339,lmacmil,May 2005,"""I drove a 3-Pedal TL, and my friends, that thing has TORQUE STEER.""  If I recall various reviews correctly, the manual has lots of torque steer but the automatic very little. I think it was C&D who said they preferred the auto TL due to the torque steer of the manual."
1340,byronwalter,May 2005,"The S4 Cab is a great looking car. Best of luck with it!  As of now I've driven the STi, TL, an '05 & '06 330i and the new A4 two liter with a stick. The A4 seems like a pretty good deal compared to the 330i (I guess that the two liter really should be compared to the 325). There was about a month between the A4 and Bimmer drive so I can't pretend to give any sort of objective comparison... other than to say that they are both great. Frankly I can live with the exterior of the 330 but it's the interior that seems wanting, especially compared to the Audi and the TL. For 40 big ones I expect not only excellent road manners but an interior commensurate with the price. Later this year I'll go back and give the A4 another spin and mostly likely buy one.  But my fav was actually the STi. That little car ducks and weaves like Ali and growls like a Tasmanian Devil in heat. Anyone that considers themselves a car enthusiast should consider taking one for a spin. But the Subie is a bit thirsty and frankly I feel that things are going to get nasty in the energy sector. I currently manage a little better than 26 mpg with my '02 A4 and guess that the new A4 2.0t can even do a little better which is pretty good for AWD.  Ah... the hard choices we must make...  Byron"
1341,frisconick,May 2005,"Great post again Byron! I can't justify the price of the 330i when the G35 can get you OTD for 30,000, and the TL for about 34,000. Plus BMW dealers won't bargain.

In fact, a website that sells tires (might be Tire Rack - not sure) will only sell snow tires as a set of 4."
1348,tstreet,May 2005,"Not sure if it was a fair fight, seeing as the M35 is about 8-10k more, but I gave each of these cars an extensive road test. I have 2 friends with TLs and I have really fallen for them. However, after I tried Infiniti's M35, I never went back to the TL. At first glance the M35 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots, but I soon realized that was with their ""sport"" edition. Turns out their base model rides much smoother, similar to the TL, and is only 40k. I opted for a couple packages and left the dealer at 44.6k Ultimately, the performance is pretty similar. They're both in that 270-280 HP range. I ended up making my decision on interior features and ""uniqueness"". One key factor was road noise - this was a hands down winner for the M35. As a frequent L.A. freeway driver, and as someone that often has passengers, this was important. Other things I preferred on the M35 - Standard 18"" wheels (19"" on the sport), more back seat leg room, and way more exterior color options. That said, the TL is probably still the best buy on the market, but I love my M35."

1350,laurasdada,May 2005,"Hi, Al:  I'm in the Boston area with an '05 non-nav TL, Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires. They are the worst tires in the snow that I've experienced in almost 30 years of driving (at least that I remember!). I got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics, common snow-driving sense and luck! We took the wife's RX300 on our few ski trips, but if I was going to regularly take my TL to ME, NH, VT etc. I would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing all-season.  In addition, I believe these tires flat spot (maybe that 's a characteristic of low profile tires?) which is a bit annoying. Other than that, they seem ok. If you get a NAV model, or 6MT I think you'll get different tires which others would have to comment on, snow-wise.  Other than the tires, I'm really enjoying the TL. Applied three coats of Zaino on Sunday, the Abyss Blue looks great!"
1351,laurasdada,May 2005,"TST, good post. It's funny, I bought my TL over the G35X because I found the TL to be much smoother, quieter ride and nicer interior style/materials. Not to mention the superior exterior style of the TL.  Probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the RL to the M35. But luckily, we both made the right choice in our purchases! Congrats, enjoy the M. It really is a nice piece of work. Infiniti's on a roll!"
1352,billyperks,May 2005,always show the frontal and side views of the M and never a rear angle shot?  Hmmmmm.
1353,esfoad,May 2005,"I bought the G35X over the TL for a couple of reasons. Nav was not important to me since I have an aftermarket Garmin that suits my purposes. I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior. I also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you don't need it making the car feel like a rear driver. I grew up driving rear drive vehicles and I just prefer them. THe wife drives a Saab 9-3 Aero convertible and it's a great machine but the torque steer, while minimized, is still annoying. It's really splitting hairs here. These are both fabulous cars. It amazes me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years. What a great time to be buying cars. I hope everyone enjoys their purchase, whatever it may be."
1354,aaargh,May 2005,"I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior.  That's odd, because I came to the exact opposite conclusion. I think the G35 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rear-seat leg room than the TL. But the rear-seat head-room on the TL I found much better. I know you can recline the G's back seat, but I found it to be uncomfortable when reclined.  As far as space is concerned, the TL felt wider (roomier), more like a Grand Prix compared to the G35 which I felt was similar to a Grand Am. (The 2 Pontiacs were my last 2 cars before the TL).  I wish the TL had better storage compartments though."
1355,ljwalters1,May 2005,"I agree with you regarding the TL feeling roomier than the G. I bet the measurements are similar, but some aspect just makes the G feel more closed-in to me. Maybe it's as simple as the fact that the G35 I drove had a black interior - that could've made it seem smaller.  Regardless I'm happy with the TL, and not sure what other storage space you would want, aaargh. We've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box. Only thing I can figure is you want a sunglass-holder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side. Overall, I think there's a lot of storage space."
1356,esfoad,June 2005,"I guess it's each to his/her own regarding space. They must be very similar. Once again, they are both great cars. The TL is on everybody's best buy list and the G35 is constantly compared to the BMW 3 series. I think either choice is a good one."

1359,sid3,June 2005,I went for a test ride for both the G35 and the TL and found the TLl way more quieter than the Infiniti. I loved the interior of G35 and the price too. The only deterrent was the noice level. It was just too much noice for the money. I wanted a quiet car for all this money.  The dealer callled me today and mentioned that the car I did the test drive had a sports package fitted on it and that was the probable cause fro the noise. He has asked me to drive one with the standard option.  What do you suggest? Is it going to be any different that what I have experienced or is the sports package designed to hear the vrooooooommmmmmm.... Suggestions will be appreciated.

They don't effect my choices, as a matter of fact, I can't think of one person who was ever swayed by a review in a magazine. For the most part the test drives speak for themselves.

You prefer power, others balance. Still others prefer the ""xyz.""  A big rating factor that needs to be addressed in this thread is real world usability. Are any of us renting track time? Are we taking these vehicles over 8/10ths? Or have the skill to? Back road driving doesn't count.  I have a Pathfinder with the Q4 engine in it and, although voted one on of the best v6's ever made, it vibrates too much for me and the g35 is worse. That, I think is why BMW is so succesful.

If that number is most important to you, your G35, IS, CTS, etc. all need to be traded in for the mighty Mustang GT. Heck, if BMW sold the 320i (150 HP) in the US I'd be driving one of those right now.  Claiming that 184 HP is ""underpowered"" is just plain silly. My E46 325i definitely isn't ""underpowered"" and neither is my 318ti (a whopping 138 HP). In fact, I'm not aware of any car sold in NA that can't reach any posted speed limit, and I'm sure they can all do it in a reasonable amount of time. My 1.8 litre made it from Atlanta to Daytona (~450 mi.) on one tank of gas (~13 gal.) while averaging 90 MPH for most of the distance.

Everyone drives a little differently.  post#: 3532 cool, enjoying a car's feel is largely opinion and owners tend to happily rate their own cars high. But I think in this performance forum, we are comparing cars side by side, and seeing their performance vs value. Is a G35 worth it, or BMW worth it. (or CTS, MB, etc) So why is a 184 hp BMW valued at $30K compared to a 298HP G35? Why would someone pay $30k for 184hp, when they can get 298hp for equal price.  Now test drives: I think you can't get a feel by just test driving, I think only after owning and driving as a owner, can you really get the feel.  Now how about this: After ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost? BMW vs G35? I know there is another forum, but I think a relfex for BMW fans in here would be ""my BMW is great, no maintenance problems at all""  maintenance cost BMW > G35 (check, maintenance forum) reliability BMW < G35 (maintenance forum, JDPower, real world exp)  So after you pay $30k, for minus 100hp, it might cost more $'s after for maintenance."

The e90 (all manual models) has 6 gears. And you keep posting the freaking e46 numbers...the car is no longer made. The e90 330i is a 21/29 and 20/30 car as I've shown you with my post from BMWUSA; in other words, the source.  And who says it's not a factor? Lexus made a point of mentioning great fuel economy with their new IS250/350. BMW mentioned the increase in economy on the e90 too. It does make a difference. I know I can beat the hell out of my e46 all day and still get 22/23 mpg while shifting at 5500-6k. I also know from experience with a G35 i'll get in the high teens doing that. And no matter how I drive a G35 on the open road...it simply will not get 30 mpg. 30 mpg as most have pointed out here is a snap with a 330i on the open road at hyper legal speeds.  After ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost? BMW vs G35?  Yes most of us did and that's why many of us opted for included service cars like Audi and BMW. I've bought tires over the past 2 years. Two sets so far...so about 2k on tires. Doesn't matter if I got a G35 or 330i, i'd still be plunking down for new tires every 13-15k miles of driving.  The people I know with G35s have had to pay for oil changes, services (some as little as $100 and others over $500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up). Getting an oil change every 7.5k with synthetic will run you at least $50. So even going low, a G35 by 30k miles will cost at minimum (not including tires) $400. My BMW = 0.  but what about outside warranty? Average buyers in this bracket don't own more than 3-4 years. I leased my 330i expressly so I'd never own it out of warranty. In other words by 45k miles I will have bought tires for my car. Has it had problems in the first 30k miles? Yep. They haven't cost me one cent. So I really don't care if the car breaks down. It goes to the shop and gets fixed. No big deal. Five minute drive to the dealer and I can always use my other car or get a loaner. :P"

Please, go drive the damn things, then maybe, just maybe, you'll discover what the rest of us have already discovered; numbers don't necessarily equate to value.  Regarding the puny little engine in the former E46 325i, take a look at the One Lap of America results for 2005. The single well driven G35 beat the single well driven 325i by a measly 170 points (5195 vs. 5025), or, said another way by a margin of 3%. Hmmm, it would seem to me that if the G35 was SOOO much better than the E46 325i the margin of victory would have been far more significant.  Best Regards, Shipo"
1371,frisconick,June 2005,"I find both cars outstanding, the BMW cost a lot more for similar performance, I have driven both. However, the BMW dealers are much less willing to deal than the Infiniti dealer. This tells me that the BMW 330Ci is selling much better than the G35 coupe."

Drive one and do a comparo to the G35 in this thread. You are quoting the latest model G35, a 2005 w/298 hp. It is only fair that you drive the 2006 325i w/215.

1373,anthonym,June 2005,"Just to add to the discussion, I purchased the redesigned 3 series in 1999 (automatic 323i) and currently still have it until I sell it. The handling is unbelievable and quick enough for me even with 184hp. I purchased the next generation 06 330i two weeks ago. I really liked the larger and wider body style and technological advances the car offered. I also test drove the Lexus GS300 and BMW 5 series but decided on the 06 3 series.  Overall I like the interior of the 06 330i better than my 1999 323i. Two aspects I am disappointed in are the harsh ride due to the run flats and the lack of initial acceleration. The acceleration is very slow after a stop. In fact my 323i has a smoother and quicker acceleration than the new 330i. The ride is much harsher and I don't get the same ""hug the road"" feel as I do with my 323i. I will seriously look at the redesigned MB C class when it comes out in 2007-2008 and possibly the next E Class or 5 Series. I don't honestly think I will hold onto the 06 330i as long as I did with the 1999 model."

""The point is, why are 325 more worth it vs a G35 (cts, c230, TL) ""  The only answer is that, from purely an economic standpoint, anything is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it. If I had wanted a 325, I would have bought it and it would have been worth it to me 184 HP and all. You're not buying horsepower, you're buying a car (to meet many personal criteria)! If all you value is HP, maybe Chrysler will sell you a Viper V10 engine for your living room...  What makes our economy the well oiled machine that it is is the lovely law of supply and demand (and, of course, competition. Laisse faire, Adam Smith and all that economic stuff...Simplifed explanation from a simple mind). Anybody can charge any price for anything they want. But, if there is no demand, guess what? That item is repriced (e.g. GM cars, ""Employee pricing for everyone!"") or withdrawn from the market (Are they still making the Aztek?). For a myriad of reasons, European cars have always been more exepensive than their domestic & Japaneese counterparts. (Although, with the advent of Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, European prices have come down. More supply/competition in the near/luxury market). However, as there is enough demand for BMW products, well, that's the price you pay, Doc. You want BMW prices to come down to G35 levels? You'd better start convincing the KDs and BlueGuys of the world not to keep buying Bimmers.  Obviously, a BMW is overpriced to you. You are correct. To KD & BlueGuy, a BMW is a good value.

Maybe I push my cars harder than most but I don't like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly."
1408,shipo,June 2005,"""Maybe I push my cars harder than most but I don't like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly.""  Hehe, I was always told that if I didn't occasionally get the car I was driving to swap ends, I wasn't driving hard enough. ;-)  Best Regards, Shipo"
1409,potemkin,June 2005,"As a matter of fact I test drove one back in November. I thought the handling was fine, not as soft as I was lead to believe, but quite comfortable. I'd add that the 6MT is a must. I also drove an automatic and there was a noticeable lag coming off the line that simply wasn't detectable with the manual.  As far as quality... The quality is fine, it's the reliability that's being questioned. As far as that goes, you might want to skip on the ""bells-and-whistles"", they just increase the number of things that can go wrong.  Oh and, the shifting was smooth and precise -- better than any of the others I was testing at the time."
1410,frisconick,June 2005,"Is that the coupe or the sedan that swaps ends? CR said it fish-tailed, but they only tested the sedan. If the coupe swaps ends, I don't want it. :surprise:"
1411,bookman2,June 2005,"That is precisely why most if not all high-performance sports cars and virtually all race cars are RWD. There is no getting around the sheer physics of weight transfer. Any manufacturer with any serious pretense of producing a high performance vehicle, will do so in RWD--thus there are no FWD Porsches or Ferraris."

I'd like to think i did adequate research, as i once again stated in my post , opinions vary , even those of these so called ""experts"". I had a consumer reports subscription, if i listened to them id be driving a TL, if i listened to edmunds id be driving a bmw... Consumer reports addressed the handling concerns you mentioned but at the same time it was also a motor trend car of the year...even with the handling concerns, so ultimately i gathered the research i performed , test drove some cars and purchased the car i thought was the best balance between value , performance and comfort."
1413,fedlawman,June 2005,"I remember my impressions of these three cars during the Lexus driving event I attended last year. They had an autocross of sorts set up, and I was able to aggressively drive the TL, 330i (E46), and G35 back to back.  As I recall, my impressions were that the TL was too soft (no surprise). The body roll was pronounced, and the car pushed through corners like the nose heavy, all-season tire wearing car that it was. It does have a fine interior though...  Next, the 330i (non-SP). The BMW had the best ride/handling compromise of the three, but it too felt soft when pushed hard through the corners. It didn't understeer as much as the TL, but it still pushed at the limit, and the body roll was significant enough for me to be turned off. With auto transmission, it was also the dog of the group.  Finally, I was most impressed with the G35. It was the Sports Car of the bunch. It had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor, and the suspension was firm (just right for me). It's remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable. Body motions were well controlled, and the car was easy to steer with throttle. I do know, however, from a not-too-recent test drive that it's freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch. It's interior, though improved last year, still strikes me as cheap and contrived.  If I had to choose one as a daily driver, I'd have to take th middle road and say the BMW has the best compromise of the group. Soft enough to be comfortable on trips, but firm enough to have fun with. Certainly closer to ideal with the Sport Package and 3 pedals. If the E90 is an improvement, it's likely a fine driver (though too bloated for my tastes).  Just my $0.02."

When I test drove each of these three cars, I couldn&#146;t drive any of them fast enough on the &#147;back roads&#148; to test their limits, and all three felt rock solid on the highway. Did the BMW have the performance package? When I drove the G35, I did not experience any excessive body roll. I drove the stick, which comes standard with the sport suspension. Was your G35 a stick or an automatic? If an automatic, did it have the sport suspension? Considering the high limits of all these cars, did you notice such a pronounced difference among them when driven at 70%- 80% of their limit?"

I love my Z3 and I will continue to take it on long country top down drives this summer. It was a tough decision for me to not get a new BMW 3 series and go with the G35, but the Infiniti suited me for personal reasons. As I also said before, these are all great cars and you can be happy with any of them, without needing to disparage the others. Have fun with your BMW."

I don't think it would have been different if i had a acura or infiniti, but i don't know that for a fact of course.  I think it's silly to buy a BMW because of the badge, but you know what? People buy BMW's mercedes, acuras, lexus, mercurys, chevys, pontiacs, toyotas, subarus, etc for the badge as well. I don't see how this should sway you in any specific direction.  dave"

I drove a 545i six speed on the street at a BMW Driving Experience , and it felt great-not flogging it-just driving normally. Yes, the I-Drive was a pain, but I sure could get used to it. Looked at the '06 3 Series the other day- still kind of tight, but really nice looking. A few friends own BMW's and they all love them. To each their own."

Here in the Boston area, BMWs probably outnumber Hyundai's, very common. Growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth (without me personally being wealthy) prior to moving to The Home of the World Champion Red Sox and Patriots ( ), I can't ever remember a comment or discussion ""stigmatizing"" anyone I knew with a BMW. The only converstaions I remember are how much fun they were to drive and how expensive and often they required maintenance. Or maybe I just care less what other people think. It's my money, my life, my choice. When someone else wants to buy me a car, then I'll let them have a say in it...  I drive an '05 TL. Could I have bought a 3, 5, C or an E? Yup (or even a Bentley. But then I'd still have to work long after I'd passed away...!). But I bought the car I wanted, given the parameters I set for myself. Have I ever heard someone say, ""Oh, a TL. Couldn't afford a BMW, huh?"" Nope. I suppose ""they"" could be thinking it, but then again I don't think I know any of ""they"" nor would I care if that is what ""they"" were thinking.  To each. If you deny yourself choice simply because of what ""they"" may or may not be thinking, have fun finding contentment. Although I often think ""non-car"" people are more content.

Going along with your logic, why would the very people who are despised for buying BMWs mock the stigma of the car? That's like saying you lived among gang bangers and never heard anyone say slammed caddies on bling rims were for punks. That's to be expected.  Ya can't swing a dead cat in San Diego or Granite Bay, CA (my hometown) without hitting several BMWs. I'll stick with my theory that most BMW owners are exactly what I described. They're not buying for performance or fun-to-drive characteristics...they're buying for so-called prestige. As that one guy said, to him the BMW says to the world ""I made it."" The massive proliferation of steptronic 325s says it all. But to each his own.  Still don't think the TL/G35 come with a stigma.

Reliability is very important to me."

At that time (1997) it was the only car I could afford to buy new. And I must say it behaved perfect. With regular normal care for the car I did not have any real problems. So, my suspicion is that maybe it is just a few individual who unfortunately had some problems with MB and/or BMW and made a big deal out of it?

1437,blueguydotcom,June 2005,But one's man's reliable is another man's unreliable. I'd rate my BMW as unreliable as it's been to the shop for two problems - broken e-brake from the factory and bad ignition coils. I'm taking it in Wednesday for an engine software upgrade.  Others would say that stuff is no big deal. So if CR were to contact me they'd hear my car broke down. A hardcore fan of a company might say both those things were covered under warranty and aren't really indicative of the reliablity. Shrug.

1440,jamesspot,June 2005,"Sign up on the BMW web site or call the phone number and see for yourself. I drove the E90 330i, G35, and A4 3.2 quattro on a closed course in Atlanta last Friday. I had driven a similar Lexus event a year ago. Told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if I was too aggressive. He never said boo - but I figured I was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake.  Observations (all cars were automatics):  A4 - Heavy and understeering. Must be hammered with tires squealing, trusting in the AWD to drag you out of corners.  G35 - A ""beast"". Good power and unforgiving handling. Transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas, leading to delays in getting the power back down.  New 330i - An amazingly balanced sport sedan. A smoother ride and more room than my '04. Active steering on an autocross course was telepathic. Brakes, engine, step transmission in sports mode, and suspension all in sync.  Did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel - shifted the BMW's steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line - woohoo!  Feed back on MY driving - needed to use the FULL width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones. I also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle / application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out.  A great experience to drive all three cars all out at a slow speed (50ish) autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course.  Anyone else done this?"
1441,joeshan,June 2005,"Did BMW X3 a couple of years ago at Belmont NY. There were no comparo vehicles, only X3's on the autocross. Also, locked in 2nd, and a real hoot.

Did MB M-Class last Sunday at same locale-not as perf oriented as BMW, but I flogged C-Class (very nimble, but not much power) Will sign up for BMW at Shea Stadium in Sept.-I hope I can flog a G35 and then a 330i.

BMW free maintenance notwithstanding, it is an inconvenience to bring the car in for multiple software glitches and such. In addition, I am not convinced that the service bays have a handle on these problems yet. You hear plenty of stories around here about BMW service departments not having a clue what gives with current electronics. A colleague of mine has a 7. She loves the car but can&#146;t wait to turn it in off lease because of the electronic issues.  So yeah, it&#146;s nice to have it made in the shade with those luscious older bimmers.

But not necessarily more balanced. Subaru's eat FWD cars for lunch at rallys. Look at the Mini-Cooper, of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4, but it drives great.  You can take an E90 and drop a V8 in it, like the rumored new M3 and then it's a different story. You will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60. In what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard. How about dropping a V8 in a TSX and then running it on a racetrack? Think it will be balanced, or it will be able to even keep up with an M3? Now I'm just using that as an example.  So yes in certain situations FWD may be preferable, in certain limited types of races/rallyes/event it may even do very well against RWD vehicles with limited torque and hp."

1464,wco81,June 2005,What kind of tires need to be changed every year? What kind of mileage before they need to be changed?  What maintenance is done within the 4/50k period? Mostly oil changes right?  Any tuneups? Any break jobs?
1465,blueguydotcom,June 2005,"Doesn't matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own, I rarely break 15k miles with a set. Went the potenza (had re's first, then got sa-03s - which were horrible) route on the first two sets and they were gone within 15k miles each time. Going with Kumho on this set...doubt they'll last either.  All maintenance is covered on bmws...brakes, windshield wipers, you name it. The only thing a bimmer owner must pay for is new tires.  So far my car has had e-brake failure, my disa valve is broken (getting replaced soon) and my ignition coils went out. All covered under warranty."
1466,wco81,June 2005,But the scheduled maintenance within the 4yr/50k period is mostly going to consist of oil changes right?  BMWs don't require tuneups until 100k miles?  How long will brakes last before the pads are replaced? That's probably pretty pricey. I don't think you'd have any old shop work on your BMW brakes.
1467,kyfdx,June 2005,"I just had my Inspection I.... that occurs at 30K miles.. At that time, they also replaced the front brakes.. The oil change alone runs $94 if you had to pay for it.. 7 qts of synthetic.. But, there is another 1.5 hours of labor on top of that for all of the checks.. And, they really do them.. they found the brakes needed replacing, plus a window regulator that was ready to go bad... This one service, plus the brake job would have been around $900.... No charge to me...  Add in two more oil services...at 15K and 45K miles... Plus, anything else your car might need...  It is not a minor matter... BMWs are expensive to service at a dealer... The included service is a big factor in the cost of operating the vehicle..  regards, kyfdx"
1468,blueguydotcom,June 2005,"BMWs don't require tuneups until 100k miles?  No idea. I leased the car...don't care about its longevity.  How long will brakes last before the pads are replaced? That's probably pretty pricey. I don't think you'd have any old shop work on your BMW brakes.  Many bimmer fanatics are into a few non oem brands for brakes. I'd let my normal mechanic do it, if the car were outside warranty."
1469,designman,June 2005,"&#147;What kind of tires need to be changed every year?&#148;  The tire wear that blueguy talks about is due in large part to the aggressive wheel alignment of the BMW sport setups. Tires last MUCH longer without the sport suspensions. For instance, a colleague of mine just replaced the tires on his non-sport 530 after a whopping 75k miles.  Performance tires will also wear quicker. The higher the speed rating, the quicker it will wear. Aggressive driving will also cut into tire life, bigtime.  Plenty of Porsche owners typically change tires between 8K-12k miles and it is due to all of the above. They don&#146;t even race their cars, not on a track anyway.  &#147;Doesn't matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own, I rarely break 15k miles with a set.&#148;  Blueguy… curious, which other cars have you owned?"

1471,designman,June 2005,"Yep, I would think that has a lot to do with it. However I still think the tire wear would differ considerably depending on cars and tires."
1472,kyfdx,June 2005,"No doubt...  But, his self-described driving style would trash any set of tires in a year..  You are right about the set-up on a 3-series.. It just eats rear tires.... But, I wouldn't change a thing..."
1473,frisconick,June 2005,"Here is CRs report on the TLs driving experience by professional drivers:  The TL's firm ride is well-controlled, with good isolation from bumps. The highway ride is steady, and the cabin is very quiet. The wide turning circle is one of the few negatives. The Acura feels taut and responsive in cornering, with well-contained body lean. The nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick. In emergency-handling tests, the TL demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph. Powered by a smooth 270-hp, 3.2-liter V6, the TL is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors. Even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer, a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration (common in front-wheel-drive cars). The engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive five-speed automatic transmission. The TL gets a respectable 23 mpg overall and meets Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle standards, which means that it is 50 percent cleaner than the average 2004 model. Braking was very good. :P"
1474,blueguydotcom,June 2005,"Blueguy… curious, which other cars have you owned?  Last 3 cars: 01 Jetta 1.8t (13k average for tires), 03 Protege ES (I got about 16k out of my first set), 03 330i."

If i had an extra 20k or so to waste , id probably trade up to the m45."
1484,frisconick,July 2005,"I got the extra cash to spend, but I still believe the TL is a much better value than the RL. And my wife chose the cheaper, but suprior can IMHO :P"

It doesn't in the usa. bmw is worried there is no market for it and it will tarnish the image. if it comes here...i think it'll be viewed the same as the tsx - some kind of tweener or bridge to luxury.  the a4 was audi's base until the a3...

1489,jsamson,July 2005,"In fact, I think the TL is superior in fit and finish, looks etc. The BMW 3 series is better than the 5 and 7. And the infiinity G35 coupe is the best car they offer.   Whoa frisco, you are truly a TL fanatic, you must have some sort of plan/manifesto when it comes to infiltrating the forums with your TL propagandha.  Anyway, i think it would be safe to say that most if not all in this forum would pick a 5 series, M45, E Class, RL over their ""entry level"" counterparts given price was not an issue.  The AWD RL ranked second in a 55k sport sedan comparo, beating out the 535i, E320?, GS430, etc. The TL is a great car without a doubt, but does look strikingly similar to TSX and even a bit like an accord, if youve ever been in the interior of an Accord EX w/ leather youd probably do a double take thinking you were in a TL, Id pick the luxury/performance/exclusivity of an RL over a TL anyday"
1490,ljwalters1,July 2005,"Re entry level and whatever you call the step ""up,"" I think only BMW (maybe Audi, too) does it right. The 2nd level (5-series, RL, M) car is faster,sometimes bigger and more luxurious. Yet for some reason, only the BMW's can be had with a manual tranny. That's probably the only reason, all things being equal, I'll take my TL over an M. Otherwise, the M sounds fantastic!!!"
1491,frisconick,July 2005,"LOL, but I can afford just about any car on the planet I want, and I prefer the TL from Acura over the RL, test drove both btw. It looks likes like a TSX from the from front , and nothing like an Accord, btw, look at the RL from the side and it looks remarkably like an Accord. The interior fit and finish of the TL is just as good as the RL, and the RL is really not much roomier. I guess I just like the sportier, lower end cars than the bigger brothers. :P"

I tried looking on the Acura website for this info but wasn't successful in finding it.  Thanks again, everyone."
1502,taxesquire,July 2005,"no there wasn't. If yu look up the '05 TL review at edmunds.com, it'll tell you what changed."
1503,delmar1,July 2005,Those are not very good pricing....as that is what I would expect from a brand new and not used car.  BTW...you did ask a question on the 'help me choose' forum. You might want to check that one out if you have not yet...as a number of us have responded.
1504,delmar1,July 2005,"Based upon your requirements...the 2005 TL is my recommendation (and which I own).  Why I would recommend? If you enjoy the luxury of a Lexus, then the TL has the mix for you. The interior is definitely superior to the G35...and will remind you of the Lexus GS series. It even rivals my 2004 BMW 7 series.  Features....it has all the items you have indicated. Bluetooth...controls, etc. If you order them through the G35...you are looking to add $7k above the TL through a package.  Stereo...6 CD indash changer...with 8 speakers with universally accepted superior performance. Controlled with buttons on the steering wheel.  Dual climate zones. Power seats. All the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy.  Performance...well it has 270 hp and the latest Car and Driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the BMW 3 series. Past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class.  As for pricing...you can get a non-navigation TL for about $30.5k...nav for about $32k. G35...$37k+ with horrible 16MPG in mixed driving. Get a similarily equiped BMW 3 series...pay $48k. Lexus GS...pay $50k+.  If you really want something different...look at the TL in Dark Green exterior with the Parchment or Camel interior...which will have wood trims included at no cost. That is sharp and similar to the Lexus interior.  So yes...you can have the world! And you will never pine to drive your Lex again"
1505,laydi,July 2005,Duly noted and tahnks again for the heads up on the pricing.
1506,quasiactuary,July 2005,Where on earth do you get $37k+ for a G35? Invoice on a G35 without navigation (to be apples-to-apples with your TL price) is $29k ....add the premium package and you're up to $32k. Invoice on a stripped TL is $30.2k. Your pricing information is pretty biased and not true at all.
1507,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"And with incentives right now on the 05s, a G35 is a good 2k lower than sticker WITHOUT negotiating."
1508,delmar1,July 2005,"Allow me to support the $37k+ pricing for a G35...as I have been challenged by another to substantiate..  A base G35 6mt coupe is $33,350. Add in the premium package ($2450), Navigation ($2000), XM radio ($400 a must if you are going to compare to the TL), splash guards ($210), plus destination ($610). Total MSRP = $39,020.  Quotes I received a month ago were at $37k+. Perhaps I could have negotiated pricing further down...but I determined the TL was for me.  To substantiate my claims...go to the ""G35 prices paid and buying experiences"". Review recent posts #2625 and #2627. Pricing of $37,030 and $37,700 respectively.  Where you got $29k for a non-navigation G35 I do not know..as the base msrp is already $33k without any premium package. A stripped down version with nothing...no sunroof...nothing....when the original poster was one that required amenities and in order to compare to the TL.  Am I biased and not true? I hope to be correct in my assessment. Let me know if I am incorrect in my pricing calculations and whether the pricing posted above are incorrect."
1509,laydi,July 2005,"Re: the 29K for non-Navi. Here's a quote from a dealer's email that I received today:  Invoice on a TL with Navi is $32,555 and TL without Navi is $30,734. I could save you a little more money, but cannot do an invoice deal. The fact that the 2006's will be out in a couple of months doesn't really help us,because most dealers in the area including ourselves will be out of 2005's before they start coming in.  And just FYI- another dealer that did not have my color combo said this... No but the market is soft so you should be able to get the car and a low price just about anywhere.  Though he did not quantify ""low price""."
1510,dhanley,July 2005,"tl with 6-speed, nav, and summer tires: 35,500.  It's not honest to compare ""shopped"" price to sticker price.  Carsdirect says 34,970 in my area for a tl with nav.  g35 with nav,premium,xenon: $35,660."
1511,delmar1,July 2005,"The pricing I provided is 'paid' price to 'paid' price. Not ""shopped"" price to sticker price as you suggested.  As I indicated...go look at the 'prices paid' at both boards and you will see (I even provided specific post numbers for the GS showing prices paid by others at $37k ).  As for the TL pricing (which includes destination costs)...you just have to head over to the TL prices paid board to validate. Even if you don't head over...look at the quote the original poster 'laydi' just received (I believe an initial $32.2k for nav and $30.7 for non-nav) and posted in a message #3903 above.  Yours is apples and oranges as Carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.  I am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. Re-read my message #3902 and you will see."
1512,frisconick,July 2005,"I would still recomend the TL for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance  The TL is fine performing machine, and is actually faster than the G35 sedan. So if laydi wants features, lux and performance, the TL is the car."
1513,delmar1,July 2005,"Still think I am misleading? My apologies...but let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead.  First...most likely than not...when people think of G35..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought. Therefore...I priced the coupe. I hope I supported my pricing of $37,000 for the G35 Coupe 6mt in my previous note. I think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site. The $37k is fact.  As for the price of the G35 sedan...I did not specifically get a pricing. However I understand that it is roughly about $35.5k. I believe compared to the TL w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.  Second paragraph. Yes...I did not bargain further on the G35 as I disclosed in my initial note. However...once again...the pricing I provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations. Please refer to the messages on the board which I referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a G35 6mt coupe). I did not make them up. $37k...fact once again.  So let me summarize. Most think of the G35 as a coupe. The G35 6mt coupe with Nav is selling for $37k according to multiple postings on this web site's board. The G35 sedan is approximately $35.5k. These prices compares to Acura TL which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.  All in all...forget the discussion of the pricing. Look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the TL...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world. The TL should be considered."
1514,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Yours is apples and oranges as Carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.  You're right...any person with decent negotiating skills should be buying lower than carsdirect.com's price.  I am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. Re-read my message #3902 and you will see.  Those people aren't very good at what they're doing. The G35 6mt with navi, xm, premium and splash guards (what blazes is that?) is listed for 33k on carsdirect.com. I'd expect any infinit dealer would beat that by $200-500.  There's a $2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the G35. That means, get the price to $200 over invoice (what one should pay for a car this old) and then subtract another $2k from the price. that's the target. of course 200-500 is more realistic.  And if you can't get a dealer to let you in on the $2k, that dealer isn't worth going to."
1515,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"First...most likely than not...when people think of G35..they think of the coupe  First, you're on a SEDAN board so when comparing the TL to the G35 we're talking sedan to sedan. Second, the sedan outsells the coupe by over 1 thousand units a month. The sedan is what MOST G35 buyers think of...as it's what most of them buy!"
1516,delmar1,July 2005,My visual survey of the road and dealership indicates G35 coupes is most common (perhaps it is only in So Calif). And from the appearance of the G35 edmunds board discussions...it also appears to be coupes are more popular. Either way....the outcome is the same.
1517,delmar1,July 2005,Please point me to a posting on the board to support your position. I am sure they will boast of their success. Once again...we are talking about the price of a G35 6mt coupe with all indicated and destination. I could be incorrect...but would like to see a posting of a materially different price.

1519,blueguydotcom,July 2005,For the kids in the back row...this is a sedan board.not sure why you're going on and on about the pricing of a coupe on a luxury sedan comparison board.
1520,brightness04,July 2005,"So you're saying then a Crown Victoria must be the best car for the money, since it's the biggest for the money?  Please don't put words in my mouth. Crown Vic is not a sport sedan or luxury sedan, so it is quite off-topic. A 530i is nowhere nearly as good at handling as a 330i, yet it is much more expensive. BMW sets the price of the two, not me; apparently size is a big factor in pricing. G35 and TL are much closer to 530i in vehicle utility than 330i."

1522,kdshapiro,July 2005,"""vehicle utility""  Your definition of vehicle utility is different than my definition. I could go to Country Buffet and get an all you can eat meal for $10 and walk out stuffed. Or I could go to the local 5 star star restaurant pay 5 times as much and walk out slightly hungry. Sure there is more quantity in Country Buffet, but there is more quality in the local 5 star restaurant.  For me the 330 has all the vehicle utility I need, plus it's the benchmark, and it gets great mileage to boot. If you haven't noticed there isn't one manufacturer in this topic that doesn't set price by size of their automobiles.  Oh and by the way the 530 is off-topic in this board."
1523,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Acura TL - 0.87g, 65.8 mph G35 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph  Looks pretty close to me. And within the margin of error, would have to say that both cars about equal in handling per actual testing.  Skidpad means zip in terms of real world performance. A figure 8, going around cone for the slalom doesn't mean a car will be a hard core performer on a track. WOT out of a corner with a TL = in a ditch. you can't refute that."
1524,danny1878,July 2005,"You could get a H2 with big fat tires and it would get a better skidpad number than either of these two.  Has it been tested yet, is there any facts/numbers to this? Nope, it's only one's feeling. The H2 probably will roll over before you get a number.  Blueguy : Is there any fact that if TL going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch. At least a statistic numbers or is it just feelings.  To each his own : ""Eventhou the car does lower number in 0-60 but I feel my car is faster."" ""Eventhou the car does lower in skid pad number, but I feel the car has better handling"" ""Eventhou the car doesnt have all the features/comfort that TL has, but I feel my car has more features"" ""Eventhou the TL has more of a muscular looking car than the two, but I feel bla.. blla.. bla..""  It must be really hard for all TLs (for being the most wanted/popular between the 3) owner that all bimmers/G owners are gunning at TL.  Fortunately TL has numbers of facts while these two has much more of a ""Feeling"".  A Long time ago people used to think and feel the world was a flat surface. If one is a patient of a mental hospital, one must feel perfectly sane right?"
1525,xrunner2,July 2005,"""Acura TL - 0.87g, 65.8 mph G35 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph""  Skidpad means nothing, it has to do with tires.  How about slalom? TL 65.8 mph vs G35 65.0 mph. If ""measured"" performance in slalom is not good indicator of car's handling ability, then what is? What else is there that can be measured that one can point to for sake of discussion?  Sometimes car magazines do comparisons of car's handling by testing lap times at a race course. But, this is not part of R and T Road Test Summary in magazine each month. Maybe somebody can find a comparison test on a race course from some magazine regarding the cars in question.  Also, Road and Track, measures BMW 330 at 65.4 mph in slalom. This is less than TL, but within margin of error, or ""significance of difference"" of 1.0 mph that Road and Track states. So, according to Road and Track Summary data, actual ""measured"" handling shows G35, 330 and TL having very similar capability."

1529,danny1878,July 2005,Excuse me but I am really interested in your answer actually.
1530,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Is there any fact that if TL going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch. At least a statistic numbers or is it just feelings.  FWD + WOT = torque steer. It's coming out of the corner where you're going to get smoked.  If you don't understand this, there's nothing more to say to you."
1531,xrunner2,July 2005,"The TL, like all Acuras (save for the NSX), has a very feminine look about it.  Don't see gender there.  I think that the TL has an Italian design flair to it, which is positive. When current design first came out in late 03, car magazine writers said it reminded them of an Italian style car.  The 3-series BMW through the years always looked very good from any angle. Not so for latest model. Front end is ok, but rest of car looks very generic. Kind of could pass for a Mitsubishi compact car. In fact if one covered up grille and badges and did pepsi type test, most folks might say it was a Mitsu or similar Japanese or Korean."
1532,frisconick,July 2005,"Your post is spot on! Actually my wife has the heavy foot in the family. BTW, I have seen tests where the TL beats the G35 sedan in ever speed test."
1533,nyrefugee,July 2005,"""I think that the TL has an Italian design flair to it,""  Thats probably true, it was definately inspired by the alfa romeo sedans which are some of the most beautiful cars on the road. But I am not sure if it quite pulls it off. I think the acura's thin headlight look leaves way too much flat empty plastic in the front. The alfa, on the other hand has a more pronounced V-shaped grill which cuts through the bumpers. So you dont get flat slabs of plastic.  http://users.skynet.be/alfaromeo/frame-2.html http://www.fast-autos.net/acura/tl13.html  and  http://users.skynet.be/alfaromeo/frame-2.html http://www.fast-autos.net/acura/tl26.html  I personally like the g coupe's styling although it could have done without the ""corporate look"" rear end."
1534,frisconick,July 2005,"I agree, but I think the V-shaped grill is the weakest part of the car's looks. In some models it's just too much, in other models it's less exagerated and looks nice. IMHO the TL pulls it off."
1535,kdshapiro,July 2005,"""The 3-series BMW through the years always looked very good from any angle.""  Look are subjective and have nothing to do with the way the car drives. Edmunds for one found it impeccable. Read the Edmunds first looks."
1536,frisconick,July 2005,"Looks are very subjective, but the first time I saw a TL I nearly fell down, I thought it was one of the best looking cars I have ever seen. Same thing happened to me when I saw the G35 coupe."
1537,xrunner2,July 2005,"Looks are very subjective, but the first time I saw a TL I nearly fell down, I thought it was one of the best looking cars I have ever seen. Same thing happened to me when I saw the G35 coupe  Agree. Think that Autoweek had first spy photo of possible 04 TL in summer of 03 in front of San Fran hotel. When I saw it in Autoweek (in silver), I thought it was stunning and wouldn't it be great if it was production model. Turns out that it was production.  If Alfa was inspiration, think that TL does better interpretation. Don't care for overdone V shape of Alpha.  G35 coupe is great design. G35 sedan very good, but not knockout like TL.  Don't necessarily agree that looks are very subjective. Think that when design is so very good (Porsche 911) or very bad (Pontiac Aztek) that most people can discern these differences. It gets harder when the designs are between these extremes.  There are elements to good design. Columnist for Automobile Magazine, Cumberford, is a former auto designer and he critiques car designs in almost every issue. Check it out. Just as in building and structure architecture (Parthenon, Golden Gate, etc.), autos must have proper overall shape, details and integration to be pleasing to the eye."

I agree 100%, the TL design takes the best of Italian design, and the groove of the BMW on the door, parallel to the door handles, that is just awesome. I really think they have pulled off a design miracle.  BTW, I am a native San Franciscan, and still appreciated the Golden Gate Bridge, a design brilliancy."
1540,taxesquire,July 2005,"I love the TLs styling. I look at it from the front and the headlight-setup reminds me of Ford Mustang; from the side its BMW M5-ish, and from the back - well, I don't know what it is from the back, but it looks nice and I think the trapezoidal (??) exhaust pipes are cool. :shades:  By-the-way, delmar, sorry I didn't have your back during the TL slam event. :mad: I left work early and have been doin' the ""husband/daddy thing"" 'til now. Anyway, I've decided to stop replying to the ""TLs are Accord"" comments. Yes, it's based on an accord, but it's better in so many ways that the educated consumer wouldn't think of them the same. I'm bored with the whole argument.  And by-the-way, the comments of whether the TL was ""girlie"" was disgusting and you should be ashamed. Beautiful is beautiful - and there are fast women drivers just like there are fast men drivers. I drive much faster than my wife, but she taught me to drive a manual tranny. What does that tell you about her or I? Nothing!!! The TLs a beautiful car for any driver. I think it looks kinda tough, and my Mom shied away from it for that reason, but I wouldn't love my TL any less if my Mom had one. It's one of the few cars that truly balances luxury and performance. She'd get it for the luxury features, including the logical voice-recognition that'd make her car-rides more enjoyable. I got it for that too, but more for its power and handling.  Anyone categorizing a vehicle as girlie or otherwise needs to grow up and define themselves by more things than what they drive or the size of their....car!!!"
1541,frisconick,July 2005,"I would be concerned about the vette's reliability, but the vette has a lot of WOW. They have a convertable with 500 horses!!! :P"
1542,danny1878,July 2005,Cant agree more!  Taxesquire : they made up a girlie category or they have to rely on feelings because they cant bash the car in reality (real world). They cant deny all the facts/numbers.  Blueguy : Changed you mind about TL ended up in a ditch.  All cars can get smoked while getting in/out of a corner. But TL will smoke them again in 5.7 secs. Hey at least I have a fact not just feeling (5.7).  BMW RWD+undepower= understeer ->speaking about getting smoked  G35 RWD=oversteer /tail out -> You get smoked too  TL FWD=largely devoid any torque steer (remedy dont leave you hands off the steering wheel while cornering) -> well I get smoked too
1543,frisconick,July 2005,"The vette is a very tempting car, especially because I am not that old yet, and I would look good in it."
1544,taxesquire,July 2005,"My dad had the last model vette and absolutely loved it. He also had no mechanical problems, and he drives cars harder than anyone I know. BTW, don't know if they still have the manual convertable top, but if they do, it shouldn't scare you - very easy to do - even faster than the electric ones.  I think it's also gotten very good write-ups as being a very liveable sportscar.  That the restyled vette's got rid of the pop-up lights is a huge plus to me. It's a beaut!!!!"
1545,frisconick,July 2005,"Although your dad had no problems, that is only a sample of one and not something I would take seriously. I have to do more research on the car before I can make a decision. I was not considering the car unitl I saw your posts. Now I am going to research the car big time.  It's a beaut!!!! No kidding :P"
1546,delmar1,July 2005,"Ok...you are partially correct regarding the Pantheon as I have visited both locations...and not a figment of your imagination.  However...the location in Paris took on the literal definition of Pantheon and named after the Roman temple. ""Pantheon"" is defined as ""A temple dedicated to all gods"" or ""A public building commemorating and dedicated to the heroes and herioines on a nation""  Generally when people refer to Pantheon...they refer to the ancient temple located in Rome. See the below link.  http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Pantheon.html  Yes....the Paris building was built after the Rome temple. If you look at your link's fourth paragraph, it indicates ""The portico, with large Corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd century Pantheon in Rome""  Sorry for the history lesson everyone...."

1549,delmar1,July 2005,Sorry Blueguydotcom....I didn't mean to impose and get up in your face and even posted further until I saw your latest response.  Hey folks....I have been posting on this forum since late this past week. Some of you thought I was bashing and all.... Just to clear the air...no...I was not flaming or bashing the G35. All my comments were straight up and honest ...and as factual as I am aware. Just some people don't want to hear the truth or can appreciate an alternate point of view. Therefore...I even gave up on the topic of discussion as it is falling on deaf ears. Alrighty....I vented.  Any how....if you folks haven't been to Paris....the Latin Quartier is great ! And take the subways...one of the best around the world.
1550,blueguydotcom,July 2005,He said fun. That negates Toyota. :P  wish they hadn't axed the second gen mr2. that was a fun car!
1551,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Del,  No problem.  I dig europe. I was just talking to a friend last night about Paris/France and Italy. She's trying to convince me to fly back there soon but we originally made plans for March when I pick up my e90 for Euro Delivery. Of course, I'm now reconsidering the e90 because of BMW's inability to fix my e46. Thus maybe I'll get a used G35, new Miata or a new TSX to hold me over for a few years until the M3 sedan shows up."
1552,delmar1,July 2005,Good...glad you understand.  One last travel tip for the folks here....especially those that like to travel. You have to consider visiting China. The foreign currency conversion is incredible (why pay the 30% premium for Euros when you can still get ~15% discount to the USD). Incredible to see not only the historic and ancient China (ie TerraCotta Warriors of Xian)...but to see the incredible industrialization. I never seen so many cranes in action in any city. All the major cities. And with that...you all can understand how the price of gas is going up with their consumption.  Cars there....the worst ! Freeway traffic in Shanghai....never seen anything like it. And they tax the heck out of you for licenses from what I understand.  Back to the TL talk. Let me ask again....the TL interior (since the focus has been on the exterior). I still say it is one of the best in the category. Thoughts?
1553,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Love Audi/VW interiors. Then BMW. Then MB. Then TL. Finally G35/IS300.  I like interiors that are cold, remote, and not the least bit cushy. I'm odd like that."
1554,frisconick,July 2005,"Most silver TLs have a black interior with a brushed aluminum finish, very cool and not at alll cushy, you would love it."
1555,taxesquire,July 2005,"And then you have to deal with the less than stellar interior compared to some other sports cars  As with all cars in this discussion, there's a balance between sportiness and comfort. I don't believe there is any vehicle faster than the Corvette, in terms of straight-out accelleration and handling, that also has a better interior design."
1556,taxesquire,July 2005,Guess my suggestions for a sporty toyota would be a Lexis SC and probably the upcoming IS.  Has the Celica been redesigned recently? I know the Eclipse has and it looks very cool!!!
1557,frisconick,July 2005,"The vette is an awesome machine, but I suspect reliability problems typical of most American cars."
1558,blueguydotcom,July 2005,"Been in the black tl. the seats are too soft on TL/G35/IS - too couch like for me. i like the taunt, hard leather used in audi/mb/bmw. hate the leatherette as it too is too soft and compliant."
1559,kdshapiro,July 2005,"Actually there are plenty faster than the Vette, but not at that price point. There are also some cars faster than the Vette that are much less expensive as in the EVO. But since you qualified it with disclaimer regarding the interior, I'll just say the Vette is a niche vehicle with two seats."
1560,geebee4,August 2005,"I'm also thinking of switching from a Passat to TL; what was your experience with the TL? The BMW 325i is tempting, but I always go with the practical car and reliability is important. The 2006 Passat sounds good, also; too many decisions."
1561,taxesquire,August 2005,"I love my TL, and I never regret switching from a Passat to a TL. That being said, let me be nitpicky. 1stly, I had a Passat GLX 5MT. Meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard. I now have a 6MT TL w/ Nav.  I believe the Passat is gonna have about 250 hp, so it's #s will be comparable to the TL, and it might even have more low-end torque, it could be faster 0-30. No way the Passat will handle as well as the TL, though, making the TL a lot more fun to drive. Both interiors are well done - the TL seems a notch above, even though the Passat had real wood and the TLs is fake. If you're going manual transmission, the TLs is by far more enjoyable. I love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.  As far as luxury features that I use, it's pretty close. The TLs nav makes it much, much better than the Passat, IMO. But if you're comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, I'm not sure what luxury features the TL has that the Passat doesn't. One is that the TLs lights shut-off automatically. Also, I like that the TL doesn't have a loud ""ding"" to let you know you're low on fuel. I'd often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time. I also like the TLs auto-a/c better. For some reason, the Passat's would always be 1 level too strong for me. The 1 thing that drove me crazy about the Passat was the steering wheel radio controls. The buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - VW got it backwards.  Here are some things I miss from the Passat: the key integrated fob (TL uses a separate FOB and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers. Also, the Passat had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (TL has 1); (2) you didn't need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the Passat gave you more info on each screen; (4) the TL makes you hit a ""display"" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.  As far as differences that aren't good or bad, the Passat's seats are more firm, the TL's are softer.  Frankly, from what I'v heard of the '06 Passat, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but I'd expect the TL to give you a better value b/c Passats will probably go for MSRP initially.  To sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line Passat and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you'll love the TL. If you're all about comfort and convenience, but won't get the nav, it might be close, and there will be some things you miss about the Passat.  Hope this helps!!! Sorry it's so long."
1562,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"Wow, they've done a nice job leapfrogging the mid-size competition. Too bad I don't trust VW to run. Pretty sweet car from all I've read.  One question...it seems no DSG with 2.0 or V6?"
1563,klpeel,August 2005,"One thing I might add in the Passat's favor (I just moved from a 2000 GLX to a 2005 G35x): the Passat can come with AWD, something the TL doesn't have. If it did, the TL might have been my choice instead of the G35x."

1568,laurasdada,August 2005,"My advice? Wait until they (the new IS, that is) are actually available for you to test drive and compare against others that may meet your criteria. You have $50k, do you want to spend it all (Acura RL, Infiniti M, MB E350, BMW 530, Jag S-type, Lexus GS430)? For $35k you could get several cars that can favorably compete with some $50k cars (e.g. Acura TL, Infiniti G35, BMW 3, what the heck Saab 9-3. It's free to test drive! And I'm a Saab guy...).  With the money leftover from your $50k, you could buy me a new Breitling. Or maybe a Girard-Perragaux. I'd even settle for an Omega!"
1569,potemkin,August 2005,"Test drive both, of course, then decide for yourself.  But I should point out that the IS350 won't be available with a manual transmission, so if I was forced to choose between either of these two I'd take the IS250 without hesitation, and regardless of price, but that's just me.

1579,frisconick,August 2005,"Actually the BMW colors are very good, have not seen many Audi colors I like very much. Saw a light blue RL that really knocked me out today. I wish the TL would have the same color."
1580,nyrefugee,August 2005,"""The coupes have too much chassis flex. ""  I am very surprised to hear this. In my experience the coupes have almost no chasis flex. This is because the FM platform is really solid, and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex. You can read reviews of the g35 and the 350z (which has the fm platform as well) and most of them, even one review that slammed the 350z say that the FM platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm. As I said that has been my experience as well, especially now that I am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of LA I find that the chasis does not twist and squirm even when i hit the big potholes.  It is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise, which sounded like chasis flex.  The problem is that the FM platform is made out of steel, so it makes the car comparatively heavy. It is not that heavy compared to other cars of its class, but it is a pig compared to small sports cars, i.e. s2000s and miatas. The G35 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but I am sure that would make it much more expensive too.  ""And in the G35c outward vision is compromised too much.""  That is only true in the back. And you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors. But I admit, this car definately needs bigger mirrors.  ""perfect comfort, poise, power, handling, reliability.""  For me the G has everything sans the comfort. The comfort is not perfect due to the hard suspension (I have a coupe with all suspension packages). But it is not easy for a car with good handling to have perfect comfort. Actually, it i pretty much impossible. But th G coupe is very comfortable for a car that handles the way it does."
1581,nyrefugee,August 2005,"""If the IS350 loaded costs 30k,""  It wont. The 350 will be expensive. Probably in the 40s decently equipped. There will be a cheaper version (IS300 or 250 was it) which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine.  Dont be confused by the 300 hp engine ... the IS 350 will not be a sports or ""sporty"" car because no lexuses are. The LExus strategy is luxury and isolation from the environment. That is exactly the opposite as a sports car which must strive to make you one with the road.  So I am not at all surprised they do not offer a manual. They are just not selling to the sports car buyer. They are selling to the person that feels good about having a 300 hp car, but does not drive it hard or care about how it handles, rather he/she cares mostly about the luxury. I.e. it will be aimed at the same demographic as the TL."
1582,ivorypearlg,August 2005,"Hey I also agree about the price... If you head to www.Lexus.com and look at the new IS video it says that the IS250 ( the cheaper model ) will start around the same price of the current IS300. Which is about $30,000 if correct maybe more . Then you figure the bigger engine extra equip and the base price of the IS350 will be around $36,000. Loaded an est. of $44,000 which isn't bad for what you get. 6- spd Auto with paddle shift, Mark Lenvinson Sterio and navigation, back- up camera and much much more ! Lets just hope the rest of the car is as great as the technology. Which it prob will be since it is a LEXUS ... What I disagree on is the buyer they are looking for ... I believe that this vehicle will be in the demographic of the 325I / 330I and the G35. They also mentioned that it is sharing some components with the bigger GS but will be sportier. Lets keep our hopes up ! ! !"

Why, the '05 V6 Mustang (Not the V8!) is said to be faster than an '84 Corvette. I had a 5.0L V8 Mustang ('82) that put out a whopping 158 HP. Oh boy, we live in interesting times.

1589,shipo,August 2005,"""Why, the '05 V6 Mustang (Not the V8!) is said to be faster than an '84 Corvette.""  Geez, I think our 3.8 liter V6 Dodge Grand Caravans are both faster than a 1984 Corvette (in a straight line that is), so a 2005 V6 Mustang beating that same Vette should be no trick.  Relative to the IS, I'm thinking it is a tad overweight for the size of the vehicle. True, I haven't seen it yet however it is weighing in at over 150 pounds more than an E90 325i, and it sounds like it has a smaller interior (in terms of legroom) than anything else in the class, consider the following:  Vehicle ---------- Total Leg Room ------------ Vehicle Weight Audi A4 2.0T --------- 75.60"" ------------------------ 3,362 lbs.

No official acceleration figures are available, but our unofficial stopwatch clocked the IS350 at 5.9 seconds from 0 to 62 mph, in stark contrast to the 2.5-liter's 7.3-second sprint. Power is instant and progressive, offering a far more compelling experience than its predecessor. We hit an indicated 165 mph in the IS350 and 149 mph in the IS250.

1603,ivorypearlg,August 2005,I also think that Infiniti G35 also has great ride handling and steering... The only thing Infiniti lags is a great appointed interior and that German heritage

I don't know about you, but I can't tell 0.3 secs from the seat of my pants, and dynamically, the 330i blows the G35 away in terms of ride, steering, and poise.  The G35 offers tremendous performance/luxury bang for the buck, but in my opinion, the 330i is the superior drivers car."
1605,ivorypearlg,August 2005,"Well I think the G has great ride even thou I have a 03 coupe, but when I went in for a scheduled service they gave me a G35X and the ride was great. I also test drove the 330I also good ride handling and overall goodness to put it in short terms. But I also believe that Infiniti did an excellent job on the G and even thou I could go and buy a 750I I wont I am comfy in my G."

1610,03accordman,August 2005,"BMW does seem to manage to do more with less less power. I read somewhere that the BMW CEO said that they are not going to shy away from the HP war, but it doesn't seem that they are taking that route. In most segments today, BMWs are lagging behind other makes in HP & Torque figures, though, like i said earlier, they are able to get more out of what they have.  I am looking to get a 325 in the near future, and went to take a peek a few days back. The car looks gorgeous to me, but the rear seat is too small and low for an adult to sit comfortable, and this is a requirement for me. I will go again this weekend for a second look and then decide."
1611,ivorypearlg,August 2005,Does anyone know the engine sizes for the BMW 530I and BMW 545I ? I was just wondering because I believe Motor Trend test results had the 545I pull ahead of the Infiniti M45 ? I know the two engines in the Infiniti M class are 280hp 3.5 V6 and a 315hp 4.5 V8...
1612,ivorypearlg,August 2005,Did you bother to take a look at the new Lexus IS350 on the internet. It will be out this fall. Also did you look at the G or the Saab ? Look at everything before you make a decision

My take is they are not shying away from it, but you're not going to see a high powered engine in a $30K automobile.  Regarding some 0-60 times. I will grant you, some mags post impressive times from autos you wouldn't expect.  So I amend my statement to read, the BMW will loose them as soon as the other vehicle goes to turn the wheel."
1615,ivorypearlg,August 2005,So the benchmark 5 does have a bigger engine then the benchmark M I wondered why the 5 was faster. I love the 545 and was going to buy one then saw the interior and it turned me off !

1618,bmwe90,August 2005,"I purchased an Infiniti G35 :lemon: soon after they were released. It was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. Nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect. I like to think of it this way: McDonalds can hype up their hamburgers calling them ""premium"" (like they do everything) and the numbers are there to support it - you get 6 whole oz. of beef - a whole ounce more than the competition. But then you realize the competition is a 5 diamond restaurant offering a burger as well - you can see where I'm going. I recently purchased a new 3 series. It easily makes it way to 100 without the steering wheel shaking as in the G. the wind doesn't whistle through the cut rate seals on the doors as it did in the G, and finally when I brake, I get smooth, modulated pedal action which brings me to a quick stop. In the G, the whole car shook from the severely warped rotors which they tried to fix on more than 5 occasions. So if you value smooth and quick acceleration, a solidly built car, and powerfully smooth brakes, by all means spend the few extra bucks and purchase the 3. If you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the Sentra - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the G. In defense of the G, It is probably the car that comes the closest to the Bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series."
1619,ivorypearlg,August 2005,"I believe that BMW doesnt have horsepower as a core value they rather span out and try to make everything a little bit better not just one thing.

1620,bmwe90,August 2005,"Don't get me wrong, I did like the G, I just got a big :lemon: and now i have to vent. I shouldn't be mad, Infiniti did practically pay for all of my new 3. But it is good to hear that they are actually treating their customers with the respect (and good loaner cars) that they should."
1621,ivorypearlg,August 2005,Well then I must be a special customer because I always get current Infiniti model cars. Infiniti of Willow Grove !
1622,ivorypearlg,August 2005,Yes they are treating me good ! I just ordered a Ivory Pearl FX45 for my wife ! I will be done financing my G35 Coupe in November .. I am going to buy another Infiniti then too maybe a Lexus or Mercedes. I dont know yet !
1623,blueguydotcom,August 2005,Did he say he needed RWD maybe he lives in snowy climates the Saab will plow thru the snow while the RWD IS350 and the 3'S RWD and the RWD Infin will be stuck in the garage. Look at the Acura TL too.. AWD G is great also.  I'll wait for the snow-living RWD owners to refute your 1980s thinking about RWD cars and snowy climates.
1624,ivorypearlg,August 2005,Sorry but my brothers 330I is horrible in the snow ! He lives in Maine. When it snows he cant drive his 330I so his wife drives him to work in her SAAB 9-5.\  Last time at Infiniti a lady was trading in her G sedan for the G35X because she couldn't drive it in the snow. As for me I have the luxury of having 3 cars .
1625,shipo,August 2005,"""Sorry but my brothers 330I is horrible in the snow !""  Uh-hu, not buying. My bet is that it's not the car it's the tires. If his 330i is horrible then it has the summer performance tires, which BMW overtly states should not be used in the winter. If his car does not have the Sport Package and has the OEM All-Season rubber then you are overstating the case. My first BMW was a 328i with almost identical rubber as a 330i non-SP, and while it wasn't the best car I've ever driven in the white stuff, it was certainly capable of getting from point A to point B with a minimal amount of fuss. I then got a 530i SP and ""YIKES"", that thing was horrible in even a bare dusting of snow. Remember I stated ""...it's the tires""? Well I put a dedicated set of winter skins on my 530i and Presto-Chango, my car went from the worst winter car I've ever driven to the absolute best, FWD cars included.  What's that you say? I don't live in Maine? You're right, I live in New Hampshire, and over the last three winters we've had over 300 inches of snow. Through it all my 530i only stayed in the garage when the snow was so deep that it would have been nothing more than a snow plow if I'd taken it out. That said, six to eight inches of rutted snow was no problem, even with all of the undulating roads (vertically and horizontally) that we have around here.  Best Regards, Shipo"

1634,klpeel,August 2005,"bmwe90, sorry for your bad experience with the initial version of the G35! I just bought a 2005, and believe that significant improvements were made in the last two model years. That doesn't excuse the problems you faced, or excuse Infiniti for coming out with the G with so many initial problems (at least with your car), but... The conversation on the BMW3 vs. G35 is interesting, but really I think the two cars serve (slightly) different targets. For me, the 3 series was just a little too small and a little too expensive to meet my needs. If I valued absolute performance over all other considerations, then my choice would have been similar to yours."
1635,jrock65,August 2005,"I don't think the new 330i ""blows away"" the G in handling, but it is a better handler.  With the 330i you get better handling and the BMW badge.  With the G35 you get better straight-line performance, more interior room, and about $7000 left over.  Of course, nothing beats the Lancer Evolution or the Impreza Sti if you want the most performance for the buck in a sedan."
1636,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""With the 330i you get better handling and the BMW badge""  That is the BMW badge."
1637,taxesquire,August 2005,aren't the Lancer and WRX pushing $30k these days?
1638,bmwe90,August 2005,"If I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased the G35. But if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - I would say yes, of course. From what I gather from the many happy G owners on this board, Infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than BMW's 3 series. If I hadn't had my sour experience with Infiniti, and I were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the G would definently be on my shopping list. The higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the G provides more interior room than even the new 3. I agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. I did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my G before it was gone. I have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. I will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (I'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my G)  The G was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+). the BMW seems more at home the harder you push it while the Infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the BMW does it with a smile. The BMW has the better interior hands down, quality wise, I wont comment on style because that very objective. The BMW is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. It seems once you get situated in the BMW, no one complains from lack of space. The Infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seats also recline in the G. The engines are a tossup, I think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine I have ever owned. The transmission in the BMW has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. I had a full size spare in my G and I loved it. I don't like the new run flats on my 3. I prefer the BMWs brakes though. BMW does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.  They are both great performers and I think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class."
1639,frisconick,August 2005,"The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+).  Unless you are in Montana, you are not supposed to be going 90+ :P"
1640,kdshapiro,August 2005,Yeah to bad it doesn't handle as good and goobles gas. Seems to me the G35 is trying to aspire to be a BMW.
1641,frisconick,August 2005,"The G35 coupe does handle as good as the BMW, but does gobble gas, with a 298hp engine, that wipes out most BMWs except the mucho expensive M, what do you expect. If you want to save on gas, buy a Prius. :P"
1642,kdshapiro,August 2005,"Actually it doesn't wipe out anything. HP is not the be all and end all. My guess the 3 manual would beat it on the laps, just like in the R/T comparo. It may get to the red light .0001 seconds faster than a 3er, but that's about it.  Now if you want to say the 3 is more expensive I'll agree. But the two cars have different missions in life. You may be one of the rare few people that actually enjoys paying $3/gallon."
1643,frisconick,August 2005,"HP does mean a lot, 0-60, 1/4 mile etc. the G wipes out the the BMW 3. I don't mind paying $3 a gallon in California, it's only a few hundred a year, big deal, are you so poor you can't afford that? If so, buy a Civic or Prius. :P Buy the way, those are two great cars."

If I were you I'd apologize for that poor statement. It's totally uncalled for and it will get your post yanked.  There's nothing sensible about wanting to blow $3 every 18 miles.

1645,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"Saigon,  Only you can tell if the ZPP v. ZSP v. ZHP makes the difference for you. I found the standard and zpp cars to be a little puffy. The Sport Package 330i was fun. ZHP more fun. In the end, even the ZHP is too soft for my style of driving.  What was wrong with waiting 10 weeks? You've waited your whole life...what's 70 measely days?"
1646,kdshapiro,August 2005,Okay. Show me a comparo where the G wipes out the 3. I can show you one where the 3 wipes the G.  I just ran across this...just for a break in the conversation:  http://www.caranddriver.com/article.asp?section_id=29&article_id=9902
1647,frisconick,August 2005,"Unless you are a Host, I am not apoligizing for anything. I am not saying that the G35 is dominant, just a better value than the BMW, I think that's what is really bothering you. Additionally, if you can afford a 35k car, poor mileage isn't going to force you into the poor house. Buying a G35 298hp coupe is not a sensible buy, you are buying a great sporty car that gobbles gas, you go in knowing that."
1648,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""I am not saying that the G35 is dominant, just a better value than the BMW,""  I agree it's more expensive, but everybodys definition of value is different. And that's what this conversation is about. Yes gas price shouldn't matter, but the fact is with a smaller engine and less hp and power, the 3 series holds it's own against the G. Most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark.  However, having said that, there are real reasons for looking at other manufacturers. BMW has always been the drivers benchmark, which is one reason I am interested in them. I don't care for the other stuff such as DVD-A, nav etc, give me a well tuned creamy smooth vehicle that almost drives me and I am happy.  I wouldn't throw the G, TL or any other car out of my garage if one landed inside. I just wouldn't pay for them."
1649,frisconick,August 2005,"Great post!!!  Please, don't get me wrong, I love BMWs, and I am considering the 330ci, and the M3, but I just can't justify the cost over the G35 coupe, even though I can afford it. For the same reason I an considering MB, but I can't get over CRs low reliability ratings for the MB. By the way, CR does recommend the BMW 3 series."
1650,brightness04,August 2005,"Most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark . . . BMW has always been the drivers benchmark, . . .  Most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark not because of the car itself but because it is a BMW 3 series. BMW is not the driver's benchmark; it's the benchmark for sport sedan marketing. E36, E46 and E90 have been significantly different cars, getting softer in every generation. The new E90 is softer than the E34 5 series. What kind if drivers' benchmark is that? unless you are saying that drivers are a dying species. It is a marketing benchmark. BMW has been a great marketing phenomenom."
1651,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"hosts don't ask you to apologize, they just yank inappropriate posts. Odds are good come Monday the post will be gone. They don't take kindly to personal insults here.  I can afford either car. The gas mileage matters to me. I want 30+ mpg when I'm taking a road trip.  No, the extra stops with a G35 wouldn't make me sell a house or anything but it would make me think twice about going to the movies (25 mile round trip) or driving to LA. It's more psychological but it's real to me nonethless."
1652,play,August 2005,"I'll second that, blueguy. I wouldn't consider an Infiniti. It's no secret that Infiniti is poorly engineered. Any car that needs 35% more gas ( these are the realworld numbers I have read) to approximate the performance of its competition is poorly engineered and not worth considering, IMHO.  Carlos Ghosn arrogantly stated how people do not care about fuel economy. He turned Nissan around and yet has now left it ill prepared for future times. All their models compare poorly in this regard. It's unfortunate the chairman was not as well rounded as he thought he was."
1653,frisconick,August 2005,"On second thought, I do apologize. I re-read my post and it was a very poor choice of words on my part, I am sorry. What I should have said is that mileage is not that big of a deal for me, it may be for others.  Again, please accept my apology."
1654,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""BMW is not the driver's benchmark; it's the benchmark for sport sedan marketing. E36, E46 and E90 have been significantly different cars, getting softer in every generation.""  Have you ever driven a BMW? If not you should get yourself in for a test drive. Maybe you have and were unimpressed. That's okay with me. I don't have to defend the car. There are legions of reviews that seem to indicate that BMW has done right with the E90. Here's one of them. Maybe they are in the business of selling cars and they needed to change with the times to suit their broadest audience without compromising their mission of the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"".  Yes, BMW does great marketing, but they also market a superlative product. Sounds like there's a subtext in your post, almost wishing the Japanese knew how to do the same thing. I hope I'm interpeted your post correctly as it seems you are trying to say that BMW has these magazines in their pockets. While they have their biases, they are independent."
1655,kdshapiro,August 2005,"I sort of agree, although I won't go so far to say poorly engineered. The fact is their engine use much more gas for almost the same performance as some of the compeition. And don't tell me to get a hybrid please. In general car manufacturers are ignoring the $3/gallon price per gas, hoping that we won't notice either. People who say when you buy a sports sedan you give up rights to good mileage are just blowing smoke. BMW and Acura manage to squeeze decent mileage in both city and highway. The folks I know who have G35s get as low as 15-16.  The use of the same engine in all of Nissan/Infiniti models will come back to haunt them."
1656,kdshapiro,August 2005,"I don't have anything against these cars. They are all great in their own right. What I can't understand is the value proposition people often cite, when they buy a $35K car. Like: 'Yep I got a lot of car for my money'? Well that ain't so. A cars job is to take one from place to place. Lots of cars fulfull that and don't even cost $15K. A $35K car is an indulgence. People on these boards often end up heatedly discussion which indulgence is less indulgent. As if to justify their purchase.  ""but I just can't justify the cost over the G35 coupe, ""  I understand that also. Many whiles back a Honda S2000 owner said of a Ferrari: ""Why would I want one, I got a car that performs almost as well for a fraction of the price and is totally reliable"" You're the same way, the diminishing returns you get from an M3 is not worth it."
1657,lmacmil,August 2005,"The G (and most Infinitis & Nissans) is geared lower than most of the competition so it's turning several hundred rpms higher at highway speeds. That probably gives it better acceleration in top gear at the expense of fuel economy.  Somehow I doubt most people buying $35,000 and higher cars pay much attention to fuel economy though And the difference between a few miles per gallon is only a $3-400 per year for the average driver. Less than 1 car payment."
1658,frisconick,August 2005,"These mags are not independent if they take ad money from these companies, plain and simple."
1659,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""Somehow I doubt most people buying $35,000 and higher cars pay much attention to fuel economy though ""  I think today most people look at fuel economy. I'm fairly certain people who buy the $40K+ RX400h pay particular attention to the fuel numbers."
1660,jrock65,August 2005,"That's what I'm saying. To use as a comparison, EPA estimates are the most reliable source, even though they have their flaws.  I see posters on forums who claim they get 28-29 mpg on their G35, while others say they get 15-16 mpg. As you said, there are so many things that we have to take into account, like how these cars are being driven, tires, individual car variations, trip computer errors, etc.  Of course, there is anecdotal evidence that the G35 gets less than EPA and the 330i gets more than EPA, and vice versa.  The 330i definitely gets better mileage than the G, there is no doubt about that. It just seems that your ""real world"" generalization is way skewed in the 330i's favor."
1661,kdshapiro,August 2005,"The problem with the EPA it is not real world. Even they acknowledge it.  When I car shop I use the EPA as a relative guide, but I understand my actual mileage might be significantly better, significantly worse or on par with the EPA estimates.  While I do believe the results are skewed, they are fairly skewed and are more representative of real world results than the EPA estimates."
1662,jrock65,August 2005,"""i can get employee pricing on a G35...and my next car will either be a G35 sedan or 330i. the cost of a 330i optioned how i would like is not worth the $7000 premium on the sticker. but with Euro delivery, you can save close to $5000 on that same vehicle.  now i drive 85 miles round trip a day. that coupled with these other 2 factors make the mpg argument in my head a little more interesting. will i really save or do better for myself with a 330i because oin the highway i will get 30mpg and with a G35 i will prolly realistically see 23mpg?  optioned the way i want with disocunts included  G35: $ 34,000 330i: $37,000  so a $3k difference. will that be worth the mpg?""  I'm surprised you have to pay $34,000 for a G35 with the employee discount. That sounds like the street price anyone could get for a fully-loaded G35.  In any case, with a $3000 difference, I'd just get the car you like more."
1663,jrock65,August 2005,"I understand that the EPA test is not often real world.  What I haven't seen any reliable evidence of is, that the G35 consistently gets below EPA, while the 330i consistently gets above EPA.  In other words, you're saying that the way that the EPA conducts its test somehow favors the G35.  Again, there are posters all over the forums who say that their G35 gets worse, at, or better than EPA. There are also posters who say that their 330i gets worse, at, or better than EPA."
1664,kdshapiro,August 2005,"The people who drive these cars know what it costs to fill-it-up at the pump and what their gas mileage is. I have a very small sample size, but my sample size might be bigger than the EPA's whose sample size is one.  But I do think the mileage I've postulated probably fits under the bell curve. With thousands of BMWs and Infinitis you or I obviously can't predict the mileage of each and every one. But I believe I'm close to real world figures."
1665,minarets1,August 2005,"well it is like $33,500...and that is for a MSRP $40,000 G35...fully optioned with NAV, prem C sat radio...everything."
1666,andy,August 2005,"I agree that anecdotal evidence is not really valuable info. But in certain cases it can be. For instance, we all know that the Prius does not get anywhere near 60mpg in the city based on the VOLUME and % of anecdotal evidence.  I have read many forums and both the G and the RX-8 get pretty bad mileage anecdotally relative to their EPA estimates. But I haven't really studied the new 3 series. The last one was pretty spot on to the EPA."
1667,anthonyp,August 2005,Which one would you like to be seen in? There is alot more importance in how you feel than just the initial expense...Tony
1668,frisconick,August 2005,"Gas prices are only going to get higher in the future, so mileage with become more and more an issue. A reason my wife chose the TL was it's good highway mileage, and it's very low emissions. She is somewhat sensitive to enviornmental issues so that's important to her."
1669,shipo,August 2005,"One factor that is significant in my mind is that BMWs (and MBs and VWs and Audis) are built to obtain their best gas mileage at speeds well beyond what we typically drive here in the U.S.A., the EPA and their 49 mph test be damned. When I was picking up my ED 530i I spent the first 1,300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph, and during that most critical of break in periods I obtained between 26 and 28 mpg. For the last sprint back into Munich I had the cruise control set at 130 and according to the trip computer I was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg. Geez, my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a G35 gets at half that speed.  Now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence, I must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the TownHall I seen literally hundreds of posts by BMW 3-Series and 5-Series drivers claiming mileage well beyond the EPA numbers (and precious few that couldn&#146;t). Once again, in my mind that is significant. In fact, a few months ago in the 5-Series forum, a contributer was complaining that his E39 530i was barely able to make the EPA numbers. The rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car, contrary to what his dealer was telling him. I mentioned to him that I was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of Munich that was, ummm, less than optimal, and suggested that he have his OBC reflashed. Bingo! He immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing, which by the way was well beyond the EPA numbers.  Best Regards, Shipo"
1670,blueguydotcom,August 2005,Which one would you like to be seen in?  LOL
1671,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"Shipo, stop making stuff up. You know BMW owners are prone to over spend, they want to be seen in our blue and white propellor badged cars (with matching beanies) and we all lie about gas mileage. Oops, did I write we? I meant you or they."
1672,saigonboi21,August 2005,"well just wanted to say that I just got my 330i and im loving it!!!! and thanks to those that have helped me - blueguydotcom, kydfx (cant remember everyone but thanks)"
1673,blueguydotcom,August 2005,enjoy! Show us pics too.
1674,pat,August 2005,"Congrats, saigonboi21!  Hey, I moved your last post to our ongoing 3-Series discussion since that's a better place for your question than this comparo - here's the link: saigonboi21, ""BMW 3-Series 2006+"" #4009, 23 Aug 2005 2:31 am.  Enjoy your new ride!"
1675,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""Now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence""  I too refute anecdotal evidence. To me anecdotal evidence rears it's ugly head in the form of statements like these: ""I heard all BMWs unreliable"". Or, ""I heard the G35s guzzle gas"". However, what I hold near and dear is first hand information. Anecdotal evidence is taking a small sample size and making unscientific broad predictions based on that small sample size. We hear can ignore fact that Nielsen predicts the habits of 35million people from 1000 people  There is a percentage of people who will hit the EPAs number because they drive the car exactly as it was tested. For the rest of us that don't drive as tested our actual mileage will vary + and -.  So while I'm not forming a scientific conclusion about G35 gas mileage, what I've seen first hand has me wondering if the mileage could more on par other cars in this category."
1676,paradigmslug,August 2005,"I have a 2004 G35x (the AWD version). With a commute of 30 miles per way, travelling at about 75mph, I have been avg about 22.5 miles per gallon. I know its not sipping but it is much better than the 13 to 15 mpg reports I have read in the past. But I do concede, that when my commute has been less, say 12 to 15 miles per way, that average has dropped to about 18 mpg. The car seems to really like the long, uniterrupted travel the best, at least from a mpg standpoint."
1677,humphry,August 2005,"This EPA/mpg discussion is really crazy.  I drive the bedevil out of my G35 coupe almost all the time, spin around corners, shifting all 6 gears up and down like I am playing pacman with it, low gears and hi revs while listening to that sweet sound coming from the exhaust, switching lanes along the highway, enjoying all 280 horses of that sweet torquey V6 engine, while imagining myself from the outside in that sexy looking body style.  I have no idea how much mpg I get ...heck I dont even know the EPA rating....and I dont even care to check. I know I am not spending as much at the pump as an Escalade or Hummer driver and that is as much as I probably care.  If gas prices get too high ....really high !...I probably go and get a honda civic or a corrolla...(I like the hybrid Honda V6 too).  For now I probably will change my G35 coupe only because I get bored easily but I will get another sport coupe and I wouldn't care less about the EPA or the mpg."
1678,aaargh,August 2005,"I like your attitude. :shades:  But I think you have to admit that you are in the minority. This discussion, while going on too long now, is important to many of us. Maybe not the pissing match between the G35 and BMW spinners, but about the reality of the EPA numbers and how different types of driving effect your overall mileage.  I'm surprsied nobody has mentiond the great mileage the TL gets with a 270 HP engine (at least on the highway - over 30 mpg.). Yes, I am a TL spinner."
1679,toyotaf1fan,August 2005,"The Lexus Canada website has fuel consumption for the 250 Manual at 24/37. The 250 Auto is 29/42. The 350 is rated at 26/37 mpg.  Great mileage, but doesn't it seem odd that a 2.5 liter with a Manual transmission is getting worse mileage than a 3.5 liter auto? One would have to think its a typo."
1680,kdshapiro,August 2005,There must be a lot of denial going on around here. :confuse
1681,oac,August 2005,"you gotta ask yourself, how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world? .... A vast automotive conspiracy? Bias?  BGDC: On the face of it, that an unreliable BMW beat out a new IS350 smark of conspiracy, don't ya think ? Let's see, of the 3 major cateogries - vehicle, powertrain and chassis, the IS350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 (vehicle and powertrain), but lost in the chassis category. Hmmm ! The IS350 is a better car where it matters, vehicle (fit-and-finish, ergonomics, style, etc) and powertrain (performance, engine flexibility, tranny, etc). Gotta-have-it-factor: dead tie. Fun-to-drive: 23-to-22, a virtual tie. So how exactly did this broken down, unreliable e90 win ? And if you die-hard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie, you must have more denial than I think...  But more to your point: We all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3-series as the benchmark of BMW automotive engineering excellence. To beat that car will take a herculian task. And the IS350 did, even with a slushbox ! The measured (objective and subjective) difference b/w the e90 and the IS350 is infinitesimal, at best... virtual tie at worst. That it took Lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted 3-series is what counts, not the unreliability of the Bimmer or the money flush at Toy/Lexus. At least, they put their money where their mouth is."
1682,oac,August 2005,"Don't look now, but the ""total package"" is missing a manual transmission (assuming you're referring to the IS350). As you yourself expressed, ""Just imagine the IS with a 6MT."" Imagine? I'd rather they actually make one available, but that's just me.  For how many people in the NA market ??? Even BMW sells far more slushboxes than stick shifts. So ?  The IS300 I drove had more HP & ""TQ"" than the 325i (E46) I bought. Why did I buy the 3? Because ""HP isn't everything,"" and that's a fact.  Then what is ? Oh, I forget... the name and the hype - the ultimate driving machine.. always trumps reality...  I like the new IS more than most, but without a clutch and H pattern shifter available the 350 isn't even a consideration. If I were looking at purchasing a new car this fall, I'd be looking seriously at the IS250, not the IS350.  And you'll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category. Your loss is someone else's gain... There won't be enough IS350s for the demand, you can bet that.  By the way, a V6 is a step backwards over the previous I6  The same ol' song from BMW officianados... the V6 in the IS is smoother, more efficient, provides better MPG than an I6 can ever be. And it is technologically superior to an I6. There !"
1683,kdshapiro,August 2005,"""And you'll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category. Your loss is someone else's gain... There won't be enough IS350s for the demand, you can bet that.""  Well I can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with $11B in cash not being able to beat BMW at their own game.  This thread is the redux of the High-end luxury marquees!!! Where's Merc1 when we need him.  In addition, with Katrina and current bump in fuel prices, this might not be the best time to introduce a thirsty car. Hubris about the gas mileage aside, if people drive these cars as intended they will probably be getting less than stellar gas mileage. My guess is oil will top $80/barrel shortly. Ouch! Could rain on Lexus' parade."
1684,oac,August 2005,"Well I can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with $11B in cash not being able to beat BMW at their own game.  Frustration.... what frustration ? TTC, all I'm doing is pointing out reality from hype...u all gotta remove the blinders and face the truth.... your vaunted 3-er ain't all that no more ! There is a new kid on the block now, and it is the IS350.  This thread is the redux of the High-end luxury marquees!!! Where's Merc1 when we need him.  You need Merc1 to defend ya ?  My guess is oil will top $80/barrel shortly. Ouch! Could rain on Lexus' parade.  Really ? With Lexus bringing out more fuel-efficient cars in the next couple of years, how can that hurt them ? The Prius is a best seller. The Highlander-H, RX400H are all selling quite well. The GS450H will be here in 6 months, and soon the Camry-H. What does BMW have to offer the buyers in fuel-efficient cars ? Diesel ??? Ya right !!!"
1685,pat,August 2005,"the redux of the High End Luxury Marques discussion, it is a discussion specifically about the vehicles listed above. It is NOT a general conversation about the manufacturers and it is not about each other.  Please keep your comments confined to the subject vehicles. Thanks."
1686,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"What the hell? I'd rather a disel to a gas-electric hybrid. No contest. Diesel's run forever and get outstanding gas mileage on the freeway, while still supplying great torque. Batteries, engine shutdown. i know from experience with turbo diesels that I can pound them and still get great mileage. from what I've heard even nanny drivers that do 70-80 on the freeway don't come close to 50 mpg with a prius. the performance hybrids weigh more and get basically a little bit better mileage than gas versions.  Oh and OAC you're basically saying there's a vast automotive conspiracy directing the 330i to beat the IS350 in subjective tests."
1687,bmwe90,August 2005,"When buying my G a couple of years ago I remember the dealership plastered with an article titled ""The BMW Beater"". When you told them you were also considering other options (namely the 3 series) they threw the book at you, literally (well the magazine reprint anyway). I bought the G. But even though the magazine touted the G as being a ""BMW beater"", they confessed that the only reason the BMW lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped G. The G has been selling for some time now- and guess what? BMW has survived, no wait- thrived. I equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the G. I'm not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision, but kdshapiro makes a good point- Toyota, with all of their resources, were, despite their best effort and a truck load of HP, unable to bump BMW off its seat at the top. And some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20's enough credit- I choose the 3 over all the other models because I like a car that can hold it's own as a complete package. HP is not the deciding factor for me, and I'm sure its not the only consideration for many future BMW buyers.  BUT, before everyone erupts in an argument over which sedan is superior- let the gosh darn thing arrive on US soil for sale before throwing punches. I bet BMW comes out on top in the end. It's quite a feat to unseat the old master- especially when he re invents himself with the help of one of the best automobile companies around..."
1688,saigonboi21,August 2005,I agree!!! just wait until the car gets here first instead of second guessing who's better. This discussion could go on forever. People's opinions will differ and taht's it. Hard to change someone's mind once it's set on something. Just wait til the IS gets here- then we'll continue our convo ^_^
1689,pat,August 2005,"it's about the cars listed at the top  and yeah, there's an echo in here, and it ain't of the Toyota variety"
1690,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"Ah, but entry level sport sedans in this world market with diesels are plentiful. We're not really talking out of turn as BMW, MB and the IS are all available with diesel engines."

1692,albanytim,August 2005,"Sorry, Pat.  I'm picking up my new TL tomorrow. I ruled out RWD cars because I don't want to put on snow tires every year, and I'd need to here in upstate NY. I chose the TL over the G35 AWD and IS250 AWD because of overall value, better mileage than the G, and more power than the IS.  Thanks to everyone here for helping with my decision.  Tim"
1693,laurasdada,August 2005,"Congrats, Tim. If you have the non-nav TL with Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires, be very careful in the snow. My first winter with mine here in Boston left me wholly unimpressed with the snow performace of these tires. Take it slow...!  Other than the tires, cool car. Does everything well. IMHO, best looking of the bunch, too."
1694,laurasdada,August 2005,"Regarding the Comparo's. Everyone who is simply declaring a victor by the numbers, don't forget that the judges all DROVE the cars and made their decisions. Does a 0-60 of 5.6 vs 5.8 or .84 vs. .87 g's on the skidpad really matter in the real world to you??? Read all you want, but drive the cars and make your decisions and voice opinions. Don't just regurgitate #'s from the autorags and CR (btw, long time C and D subscriber, love the mag and respect most of their opinions). Is the IS better than the 3? Is the G better than the TL? Is the TL better than all of 'em. Yes to each, if you've done the research, driven the cars and evaluated them versus your criteria. That's how I ended up with the TL.  But keep discussing. I'm sure you will convert everyone to your way of thinking sooner or later."
1695,oac,August 2005,"Yet many car manufacturers brag about HP, don't they ? We've heard for the umpteenth time how many people claim the IS250 AWD is underpowered because of its 204HP rating, relative to the weight of the car. Maybe BMW erred in upping the HP going from the e46 to the e90, eh ? Big mistake.... Who needs more HP in these BMWs, since it appears many of you don't really care for higher HP in your BMW. Oh, I get it: since the e90 has lower HP ratings than the top dogs in the class (TL, G, IS), then HP doesn't count. Right on bro'...."
1696,laurasdada,August 2005,Many car manufacturers do indeed brag about HP. And safety. And MPG. And interior space. And value. And build quality and reliability. And.... whatever they believe will move iron.  Drive/compare the cars.
1697,oac,August 2005,"Drive/compare the cars.  I have driven all these cars except the new IS, which I plan to as soon as it hits the dealer showrooms... Loved the feel of the 330ci I drove very recently, would buy the car except for the quirks... reliability issues mainly. The IS350 promises to be a great car....so I am looking forward to deciding if it is the car for me... We'll see."
1698,kdshapiro,August 2005,"It doesn't count for some, it does count for others. Lexus was never about HP, and now it is? Since it temporarily has the most HP it should automatically be rated #1 :confuse As far as BMW goes, they don't have to build the most HP to get the most performance and the best handling. BMW was never about HP. A lot of cars have much more but don't do quite as much."
1699,blueguydotcom,August 2005,"IMHO the e46 325i was worthless. Not nearly enough power for 30-35k car. Same holds true for an IS250.  If only want 200 hp, i'll go buy an A3/GTI and get a smoother, more efficient, torquier and in my view better engine than the 3.0 in my e46."
1700,blueguydotcom,August 2005,I still have fantasies about owning honda's silky 6 speed! The TSX tranny made me so happy.
1701,lovemyclk,August 2005,"OK, how about a Lotus Elise? Well over $30K and under 200HP. My point was to drive home one of the many reasons people love to DRIVE BMW's... balance - me included. I drive a 2003 530SP and find the straight-6 one of the finest engines I've had the pleasure to drive - and I've owned/driven everything from the Subie WRX STi to 911's. ""Hiccuping"" and ""stuttering"" are not qualities I've observed in my car and doubt if any other BMW owners with the 3.0L will concur unless they are using 87-octane fuel. Glad you are personally more impressed with your 1.8T and 2.0 Audi/VW powerplants.  Your comments regarding Ward's are interesting given the Holy Wars that have erupted around here based upon ""magazine comparo's"". Don't think I'd dismiss Ward's as easily as you have - what is your opinion based upon... lousy engineering expertise?... marketing dollars in reviewer's pockets?...  You can take anything in print with a grain of salt. Important thing is to ""see for yourself"", as each person's objectivity is distinct.

1703,potemkin,August 2005,"No, they're not that bad. The 5-speeds in my E36 318ti and E46 325i are 'notchy' between 1st and 2nd, but it doesn't interfere with shifting in the least. I've been driving BMW manuals for 10 years now and feel they're better than most. It's as good as most any in this category (confess: I didn't test the TL). The 6-speed in the M-B C230 I tested last year was the best in this category. By using the word 'slow' I think Blueguy is comparing all manuals to a DSG. A DSG is faster, can be smoother, wouldn't be 'balky' or 'notchy', but, personally, I'd take the worst manual in this category over the best DSG, but that's a personal preference (of course).  Out of category: A smattering of reviews I've read said the shifter in the Miata is the smoothest, but I didn't feel compelled to verify it."

A BMW tranny cannot keep up with a lightning fast shift - as in bam, clutch down, out of gear 2 into gear 3, gas, clutch out. The tranny binds and or it simply won't go into third. i can replicate this on my bro-in-law's 325i too. The tranny simply can't keep up with the kind of speed shifts I'm used to getting from Mazda/Honda trannies.  Love the DSG but still like the tactile feel of a clutch.  Out of category: A smattering of reviews I've read said the shifter in the Miata is the smoothest, but I didn't feel compelled to verify it.  Love miata manuals."
1706,potemkin,August 2005,"""The tranny simply can't keep up with the kind of speed shifts I'm used to getting from Mazda/Honda trannies.""  Hmmm... I go through all the gears as fast as my right arm and left leg will allow. Pretty sure I wasn't shifting the any of the others any quicker. My procedure is:  a) Clutch pedal down, gas pedal up, and moving out of gear all at the same time. b) When my clutch foot hits bottom it comes right up and I'd better be in the next gear (or there'll be Heck to pay!), as the left foot is coming up the right one is going down.  The M-B felt better, but I doubt if I was shifting it any faster.  As far as 'bulky' and 'notchy', that describes the 6-speed in the R32 to a tee.  ""Love miata manuals.""  Noted. I'll have to get off my derriere one of these days and try one."
1707,pat,August 2005,... things are getting personal and that's not what we are here for. We need to keep our comments confined to the vehicles. We are not here to talk about each other and certainly not here to make personal criticisms.  Thanks.
1708,lovemyclk,August 2005,"Guess one reason the new BMW M5 has the SMG is that a suitably slick 6-sp manual is not ready, although I hear one is coming. Will be interesting to see what BMW delivers to mate with the new V-10. If it's good, it should trickle down to the 5 and 3-series. Maybe the new 550 6-sp is better... someone posted that they drove the 550 6-sp in Germany and that it was FAST. Wonder what shift-feel was like in this new car?  I personally enjoy the 5-sp in the 3-series, but LOVE the Miata tranny. Honda S2000 is also sweet. Problem is that the Miata and S2000 are designed for Hobbit's and I'm a svelte 6'4"""

1710,150mphclub,September 2005,"Did you notice the asterisk regarding BMW's brake test. THE FREAKING BRAKES FAILED, and the car spun out, so they used figures from a previous years test. Give the BMW a zero for its brakes, like it deserved, and it doesn't even come in second. No wonder Mercedes didn't supply a C350 for the comparo. They knew it was fixed."
1711,kdshapiro,September 2005,"The general consensus is that the 330i set a new standard. While some may not like the car in general, it has garnered high praise. While I think BMW probably should have made sure it supplied a car without defects, this is not the first time a car, German or Japanese has failed in a comparo, and it won't be the last. Given what the car manufacturers know about how these tests are conducted, they probably circulate a beater, although at times the mags comment how they get a brand new car.  So in order to have a comparo C/D did a reasonable thing. These comparos are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway. Althouth they are good to use as a data point in a discussion such as this."
1712,pg48477,September 2005,"I have no problems with my E46 5MT either. I had a chance to drive both TL and TSX 6MT, Honda manuals do feel much softer and easier to shift."
1713,pg48477,September 2005,"You know, I did experiance the same thing in my car from 2nd to 3rd. I thought I did not push the clutch all the way down, maybe it is trany. I was not be able to replicate this though."

Althouth they are good to use as a data point in a discussion such as this.  With a grain of salt indeed ! Here are the actual scores for the 330i in the ""Vehicle"" category: 8+7+3+4+3+7+9+7+9+0+17= 74. But C&D gave it 75, to yield the 1pt margin of victory for the Bimmer. Fuzzy math indeed !!! Meaning: overall the IS350 and 330i had the exact same final score = 212 pts. A tie for 1st. Overall, I'd say the test was rigged, cos a broken down car should score ZERO, and using previous yr's number shows how much they wanted the Bimmer to win.... So much for objectivity !  For those happy that I have left, dream on... Taking nothing away from the 3-er, it simply is not the ultimate driving machine. That is all hype !  For those who won't give the IS350 a test, you will be missing a great car. I'll surely wave bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my IS350."
1715,kdshapiro,September 2005,"""For those happy that I have left, dream on... Taking nothing away from the 3-er, it simply is not the ultimate driving machine. That is all hype !""  It may be hype, and it may be rigged. But as others have noted before, horsepower is not the end-all and be-all. That's the hype, you allude to. Just ask Infiniti. I'm sure BMW execs broke open the champagne when they read this review. Lexus gave the IS350 it's best shot, but it wasn't good enough.  If your goal is stop light racing and triple digits on the speedometer I'll wave as you pass."
1716,150mphclub,September 2005,"In order to have a reasonable comparo, I gave the kid who couldn't read a B so he could graduate. He just put the wrong part on your car."
1717,kdshapiro,September 2005,And your point is what? Magazines are different or the same as college educations?
1718,johnny420,September 2005,Thanks for the input on BMW trannies. I guess from now on my point of reference for transmissions will always be the TSX's 6MT :P  Now I just have to drive the E90. I'm very curious to compare its driving dynamics with the TSX. I'll drive both the 325i and the 330i.  Johnny
1719,blueguydotcom,September 2005,"While I dig the TSX, it's the tranny, reliability and value I like. The e90 is far, imho, beyond the last gen 3 (e46) for handling that all the competition is in major catch-up mode now. Sublime is the only way to describe the way the new car feels with a sport package and a manual."
1720,cdnpinhead,September 2005,"that there are people on here even older than me.  The first time I made a 4-wheel vehicle (rode a Lambretta scooter earlier) go down the road was on a fish hatchery on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in AZ, with a three on the tree. The previous several vehicles for our faimily had similar transmissions. The thing was amazingly gutless ('60 Chev BelAir), and I still remember trying to get over Red Mountain Pass in CO, while people on foot (not really) passed us. The transmission wasn't the issue -- the six was.  Still only want to drive manuals. Mostly because they (almost) never break, and when they do, they're cheaper to fix. I tried automatics, and it wasn't pretty."
1721,laurasdada,September 2005,"It's better than the alternative!  Just finished applying coat #7 of Zaino (Z5 this time, see if I can cover up a few parking lot scrapes).

1722,frisconick,September 2005,"Your posts are great laurasdada :P  I learned to drive in San Francisco, and with all the very steep hills, I had trouble with a MT when it would slide backwards and hit cars behind me. Once I got the hang of it, I really didn't like working the stick and clutch all the time because I am basically lazy, so call me a passenger!!! :P"
1723,blueguydotcom,September 2005,"Hmm. Having learned to drive stick at 10, I've always found automatics to be less than involving.  I remember my dad - who was always trying to find ways to keep me off the roads (he had no idea I was tearing around a friend's farm at insane speeds for 6 years) - told me I couldn't take my car (the one I bought with my own money) until I could prove I could start 10 times on a steep hill without the car rolling backward. I cracked off 10 starts. He griped and walked away.  BTW, I'm entering my 9th day without a manual as a daily driver. I'm driving like an old lady now...totally disinterested in the journey."
1724,laurasdada,September 2005,"Thanks, Nick.  I used to take pride in my ability to take off from stop on a steep hill. I used to seek out challenges, never slid back in to a car behind me. I haven't driven a stick since late '01 so I' sure I'd need some practice.  Took the TL on an unprofitabel road trip today. 170 miles, 75% highway, 25% local roads. Overall averaged 30mpg @ 56mph. For just the highway portion (one way) I averaged 32mpg @68mph. I'm impressed. Beautiful day for a drive, ugly day to play blackjack..."
1725,fedlawman,September 2005,"I personally have nothing against driving a slushbox. I've driven some fun ones and some plush ones, and enjoyed them both in their own way. I just wouldn't want to own one as my only car.  So, if you're looking for the perfect car - one that costs between $30,000 and $35,000, is reliable, sporty and fun, yet luxurious and comfortable in rush hour traffic, may I recommend...  A 2001 Mazda Miata 5-speed AND a 2001 Lexus LS400.  BTW, I finally got to read the C&D comparo and the R&T IS350 review. It sounds like they both agree the IS350 is a terrific performance sedan, but one that places luxury above driving dynamics - in other words, as a ""driver's car,"" it's no threat to the 3-series.  Personally, I like a car that communicates what the tires are doing. I'll gladly sacrifice .5 secs in the 1/4 mile to drive a car that encourages and rewards good driving technique and puts a smile on my face. In this segment, it would seem BMW is still top dog."
1726,venture,September 2005,I have three coats of Z-2 PRO with the ZFX Flash Cure Accelerator applied and was thinking about applying a coat or two of Z-5 also and a few more Z-2 afterwards.  How did the Z-5 do on the marks? I have a few very light swirl marks that I wouldn't mind getting rid of. :confuse:
1727,rotoryfan,September 2005,"Handling: Definitely not Gas efficiency: Definitely not Ride: No Room: Definitely not  Wow... when did you get your test drive? Any more details you could pass on? Why did you not like the ride? Did you mean too little room in the back or the front? Oh wait, maybe you didn't actually drive the car. Maybe you are just talking out of your *** and do not have any actual emphirical data.  P.S. read a review of the 3 series... a couple of surprising notes: - an electrical relay sitting in the front windshield's rain ""gutter"" - keyless entry but you have to put the key fob in a slot in order to start the car Amazing that such engineering (relay) or silly execution (slot) could be part of the ""class leader"" in intro lux sedans."
1728,laurasdada,September 2005,"The Z5 seems to do a good job on swirlies and light scratches. I have a series of scratches going down the rear passenger quarter panel (it looks like someone let my car be a bumper for a shopping cart :mad: ) and the 3 coats of Z5 have made them fairly invisible unless you are really looking closely. No swirl marks that I'm aware of. I'll Z2 again for the ultimate shine, though. I even like the way Zaino smells!  What color is your car (a TL, I presume)?"
1729,kdshapiro,September 2005,"""keyless entry but you have to put the key fob in a slot in order to start the car""  This is dependent on the options in the car chosen.  an electrical relay sitting in the front windshield's rain ""gutter""  ???  Handling: Definitely not Gas efficiency: Definitely not Ride: No Room: Definitely not  Weren't some of these comments from the comparo? I believe it was stated the rear seat is cramped. Now that may not matter to some people, but nonetheless it was stated. But these are all subjective anyway. You have to see what you like and don't like.  HP isn't everything though."
1730,mariner7,September 2005,"Definitely not everything!  C&D had 3 categories: vehicle (won by TL), engine (by IS), chassis (by 330). 4 year-old G also bettered IS in chassis. C&D said IS lacks the poise of 3 or G.  With next gen, G certainly will have better engine and chassis, and probably will handily repass IS. Lexus really didn't raise the bar that much."
1731,venture,September 2005,"It sounds like I'm going to order some Z-5 and see how it does. I didn't order any because the car is only a few months old, but after getting three coats of Z-2 on it I can see the marks. No one else could probably see them because they haven't been as ""intimate"" with the finish as I have been in the last few weeks.  It's a jet black BMW.  Thanks"
1732,blueguydotcom,September 2005,They didn't raise the bar at all. They made a fast car. That's easily defeated by both infiniti and bmw.  don't expect a new g35 for awhile though. the car's only a few years old. i wouldn't expect an all new g35 until 2008 or more likely 2009.
1733,frisconick,September 2005,"I got the hang of a MT, but didn't really care for it. I can still drive a MT, and the new MT's are much easier to drive now. My first car was a pickup truck.  I started checking the Alfa Romeo and found out they don't sell them in the US The Alfa is very similar to the TL, but does anyone know how much they cost?  I am a statistician laurasdada, and I recommend you learn how to card count when playing blackjack, only in your head though. :P"
1734,frisconick,September 2005,I don't think people around the country realize how steep some of the hills in San Francisco can be. California Street going up to the Fairmont Hotel is extremely steep. It scares tourists.

Well, they're doing a lot of work on GTR, which will debut in a few months in Tokyo. Admittedly its engine and chassis are much more expensive than run of the mill G35. But at least some of the work, they should be able to carry over. So maybe 2.5 years from now, 3 at the most. A lot of work on M carries over also.  C&D really panned A4, saying it stood still, getting gased by the competition. I guess something has to give when you're trying to develop the useless Bugatti and almost useless LM and Lamborghini.  It'd be interesting if C350 was available. My guess is it'd finish ahead of or behind TL."
1736,kdshapiro,September 2005,I perfected my hand-brake launch start on some of those hills..
1737,laurasdada,September 2005,"I ordered the Z5 in addition to the Z2 as I have an Abyss Blue TL, my first darker color in a while. I started with two Z5 coats to hide swirlies and light scrapes, it seemed to do a good job (but won't perform miracles, of course) then on to Z2 for the higher optical properties. Nice results.  Nick, I know how to count cards: An Ace and ten equals 11, so double down and take a card! (Which my wife actually did at a charity casino night. Math isn't her strong suit. She did get a ten, so turned a blackjack into a 21...).  I'm a decent basic strategy player, but yesterday there were a couple of ""inexperienced"" players (one guy stuck on a soft 6!!! A 6!!!), that seemed to turn a profitable table around to the dark side One rather large gentleman in the sixth seat, who was enjoying fairly constant alcoholic beverages drove 'em away by eventually shouting at them, ""You're working for the casino! Stop taking/not taking cards from the table! Geez, you must be working for the casino!!!"". I shoulda walked a couple of shoes earlier than I did. Oh, well. I'm still up for the year.  The nice, smooth, powerful, economical drive of the TL on the way home took some of the sting away. Not a whole lot, but some. :sick:"

I know it's subjective but man the Jetta is so ugly sandra bernhard was heard making fun of the car's appearance. Really, the Jetta GLI is outrageously bad looking in person. It looks like someone crossed a 4X4 with a pill bug.  Same performance? not really. The A3 has returned 6.3 0-60 sprints with DSG. The Jetta GLI is consistenly getting 6.7 and above.  As for handling there's no comparing them either. Yes, the have some of the same underpinnings but the displacement of the weight is different and the cars handle markedly different ways.  I have not driven the GTI yet but for now the next year or so it won't have the utility of the A3's 4 doors.  Very different cars. And the prices differences...aren't there.

1742,blueguydotcom,September 2005,"http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/d/88304  Translation:  A good 20 years after the entry of a turbo charger in the 745i for an increase in performance, BMW as of 2006 once again turns to the turbo in order to pry out more power.  The 335 makes its debut as the strongest Model of the 3er Series below the powerful M3. The nomenclature would lead one to err, as was the case in the 1980s.  Instead of a 3,5 l motor (literally ""equipment"") there is a 3 l straight 6 cylinder with two Turbochargers and piezo direct fuel injection by Siemens.  This will put out ca. 340 PS (horsepower). Visually the potent 3er will show its power with dual exhausts.  Along side the 3er we can expect an M version of the 1er and further BMW will test a 4 l V8 biturbo as well as a 2 l 4 cyl. turbo.  If that's true, I may have to return to bmw sooner than i originally planned. 340 hp and it's biturbo? Egad that thing'd smoke an e46 M3. And with biturbos one of my chief complaints about bmw (torque-less engines) will be answered. you gotta expect at least 300 ft-lbs of torque."

Because only the handling is better than my e46's. 2. The setup's not as engaging as my e46 perf pack. 3. If i have to put up with how unreliable BMWs are, then I want the car to be ludicrously fun. An e90 is not ludicrously fun. Neither is my e46.  My plan, assuming an e90 335i is not announced, is to buy something simple and cheap - like an S2000 or Miata. I'll drive that for 2 or 3 years and wait for the e90 M3 sedan. The e90 M3 sedan, assuming it comes out, should satisfy me to a level of 91-92%.  The 335i allows me to avoid having something as garish as an M on my car and no ostentatious gills on the fenders. Plus the 335i would address something i hate about the current 3 series line up - no torque. I have stated several times I prefer VW's 2.0T to my e46's inline 6. I like the full blast of torque from 1800-5000 rpm. Having over 300 ft-lbs of torque over a broad range of the powerband in an e90 would suddenly take the decent car to a higher level - nice handling (ideally tightened up more for the 335i), matched to power for once.  The G35 is faster than an e46 and e90. So what, the car's got snap oversteer issues. I want the whole package. sublime handling, crazy power and 4 doors.  As for price, BMW bumped the price of the 325i to 330i about 4-5k. I'd hope the same bump would occur to the 335i and then the M3 would ring in at 50-55k starting. If I can outfit a 335i at 45k with just leather, sport, paint, I'll be happy."

If I am going to enjoy any performance car(though I am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 BMW323 a performance car) then it would have to be reliable!  To each their own!!"
1757,fedlawman,September 2005,"""though I am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 BMW323 a performance car.""  I think your definition of performance is spot-on.  You may not have M3 horsepower, but you also don't carry the extra 300 lbs., and you don't feel the road through wheels/tires that are almost a foot wide and weigh 50 lbs/corner!  Anyone can drive a 300+ hp car quickly, but it takes real skill to go fast with only half the horses (and it's more fun).  I'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over HP any day - that's my definition of performance."
1758,frisconick,September 2005,"I agree that hp is not everything, but I really like the M3 and M5. However, with respect to BMWs, I am concerned about reliability. But I must add CR does recommend the 3 series BMW because of recent good reliability ratings."
1759,dewey,September 2005,I'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over HP any day - that's my definition of performance.  I agree! HP in itself does not make performance.

1761,kdshapiro,September 2005,"They do, but their evaluations have not meshed with mine for a very long time. Therefore I find the only way to find a car is to knock on every dealers door and test drive every car you may be interested in. And that's what I do. In the end, I make the decision based on the utility/form and function and financials. Nothing else. I don't consult the statistics purveyors or the mags. Oh and if possible I do consult with people who have these cars to find out their experiences with the car and the dealer.  The only time in many, many years I had buyers remorse is when I didn't get the M3."

1785,joeshan,September 2005,"Yesterday, I participated in the BMW Ultimate Driving Experience at Shea Stadium, NYC: G35 w/ sport pkg (18'' Eagle NCT's) Audi A4 3.2 q (17'' Eagle F1's) BMW 330 (18'' Potenza RE050's) The Audi had the best exhaust note, the slowest acceleration, the most body lean, and ok room inside. The Infiniti felt quickest, had the most room inside, understeered slightly more than the BMW, and was more ""point and squirt"". The BMW felt solid, oversteered enough to be fun, was tight inside, and had uncomfortable, hard rear seats. There was a big bump on the course that really upset the cars, with the BMW tracking the best over it. On the street, the 325 felt great in normal driving, but the tight interior convinced me that I made the best choice for myself and my family by buying the G35. Oh well, there's my .02! P.S.: On the street, the 540 was nice and roomy, but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is ""sterile"". I'll take an M35 or 45 any day. The Z4 just seemed like a toy; not my cup of tea."

The E90's interior is less unique, more generic, less ""traditional BMW"". It seems more similar to what you might find in an Audi (not that that's bad -- just not distinctively BMW). Even the C&D review mentioned something about not caring for dash design."
1794,dewey,September 2005,"True, the e46 cockpit- feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame! And the reason the E90 has become more generic is because it is ""less sterile"" than older BMWs.

1796,dewey,September 2005,Is anyone in this forum old enough to remember when most people laughed when Toyota introduced a luxury line called Lexus?

Hyundai will be introducing a 3.5L RWD luxury sedan and should be on our shores early 07!  http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=107396
1797,blueguydotcom,September 2005,I keep mentioning Hyundai pulling off what Toyota's done in the past 16 years. So far people scoff. So did BMW/MB in the 80s. They're not laughing at Lexus now.  15 years from now will Hyundai be the new Lexus? I wouldn't count them out. They've gone from 1980s joke (much like Toyota was a joke in the 60s) to strong value contender in the 00s (much like Toyota in the 80s). It's not beyond the realm of possibility for the 2020 Hyundai AL760 Entry Luxury Sport Sedan with 1500 hp to be the big contender aiming to knock off Infiniti and Lexus' aging but still popular platforms.
1798,bdr127,September 2005,"Yeah, a lot of people just thought ""Lexus"" was some gimmick.....  Although it seems crazy now, I'm sure that Korean cars will be generally accepted by the public within 10-15 years.

1803,jiminthehills,October 2005,"Thanks, guys for the input.  I posed this heat question to some of the engineers at work and one of them told me to take two thermometers to the Acura dealership at 2pm and quickly throw them into the two candidate's passenger seats and let them bake in the closed cars for 20 minutes. Then, open the driver's door of each car and observe the readings as they come down over the next 5-10 minutes. This may be more telling than what I could tell from a subjective ""seat-of-the-pants"" test.  Not bad advice - I actually may do it!

1805,tturedraider,October 2005,"I have a suggestion that might give you the best of both worlds.  Tint your windows. I HIGHLY recommend Llumar brand. I have used Llumar for over 20 years and it is excellent. I have never had any problems with hazing or bubbling. Their top tier tint comes with a lifetime warranty.  Choose the top of the line Llumar product and I'm sure you will be pleased. Be sure to choose a ""metalized"" tint. They have tints now that block virtually all UV rays and have high degrees of heat rejection. You don't even have to get a really dark tint to do the job.  I always use about the second lightest tint and have very good results.  I am a big believer in white cars. I live in the Great state of Texas and you know we have tons of HOT sun! I don't have empirical evidence, but in my experience I have found that even light colored cars absorb significantly more heat than white cars do. Plus, I admit I really like the brightness and cleanness of white. Even though it seems counterintuitive, white actually hides dirt better than any other color.  High quality tinting also protects and preserves your interior.  If you have tinting on your windows and use a reflective sunshade :shades: in your windshield, I'll bet the black interior won't be too bad. btw - leather adjusts temperature much faster and better than vinyl.  my .02, fwiw  also, btw - don't get the tint done by your dealer. They'll charge you at least twice as much. Find a good Llumar dealer and let them do the installation. That's what your dealer would do and then double the price to you."
1806,ggesq,October 2005,"Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't a ""metalized"" tint make it more difficult for the Navi (assuming you have one) to function properly?"

1810,tturedraider,October 2005,"sorry....kinda corny, I know.  Acura would have to give me an exceptionally good reason not to tint. I have tinted all my cars since 1982 and never had any problems.  I know lots of the car makers are using so called ""green"" glass, but, imo, it doesn't do the job. Personally, I think high quality tint looks nice. But, without question, it significantly (even dramatically) reduces heat intrusion."

The tires in those days were 14"" bias ply tires and very skinny by today's standards. I won my class a couple of times running 14.3 seconds @ 100mph.

1834,blue01s4,October 2005,"Seems like you have to decide first what you want. With BMW you are definitely paying for the name, and less performance in comparison to the G35. With the G35 are you looking at the AWD version or only the RWD? In either configuration, it seems the G35 would be the better performer. Audi A4 2.0T would be another vehicle to consider if you want AWD and comparable performance to the Bimmer, but I still think the G35 would out-perform the Audi. However, the Audi does have significantly more tuning potential compared to either car being that it is turbocharged (if you are into that kinda thing ).  Other things to consider are warranteies. Both Audi and BMW include all service in their warranties whereas Infiniti does not. It may be something to factor into the price - Do you mind paying more up front for 3-4 years of expense free driving or not? Then of course you get into talking about reliability, and I'll let you do the research on Edmunds to come to your own conclusion about that.  Good luck."

First of all, RWD with best snow tires can never compete against AWD with today's all-season tires going up hill on slippery conditions; there is simply no contest. Second of all, RWD on snow tires can not begin to compete against AWD with all season tires on dry ground. On top of it all, AWD has significant dynamic advantage in rain conditions.  The nimble feel of an RWD vehicle trumps the idiot-resistant AWD vehicle every time, in my world.  The only advantage (besides the financial one) RWD has over AWD is the ""nimble"" feel. If I were getting a roadster, that would indeed be my paramount concern. Some people may indeed prefer small displacement engines that takes a lot of revving to squeeze out power because that is more fun and takes more ""skill"" . . . It's strictly personal preference. Don't apply your set of values to other people who are buying a sedan (by definition a compromise vehicle), and a ""luxury performance"" one at it."
1896,esf,November 2005,"That's completely untrue about AWD cars... I own an '05 Audi S4 Cabriolet, and I've had it since mid-April. It is not any more nose-heavy than the Acuras I've had before my Audis. It's not very nose-heavy at all, and it does not have maintenance problems. For every BMW that I've played with, I've easily blown by (and that includes many current M3s). It was sort of amusing, there was a man with a 330ci convertible who looked very annoyed, driving out of a parking lot. I was coming out behind him, and he was really pushing it. I let him stay ahead of me for a while, and then with no effort, passed him, without Sport mode. At the light, he stared at me with wide eyes. It happens a lot. And, again for maintenance problems, the only problem I've had is a faulty air conditioner when I bought the car. They gave me a Pontiac Grand Prix, and were so embarrased by the mix of crappy rental and bad A/C that they gave me a free set of 17s for the winter."
1897,al57,November 2005,"Fellow posters,thanks for the great response to my original post,seems like we all have our ideas of AWD FWD AND RWD and how we drive and handle our cars in a given situation..The decision of TL VS. G35X is still to tough..  Now,can we discuss possible large scale changes on G35 for 2007,and has anyone bought a non nav TL and negoiated to get the Michelin tires installed and how much and how do you price out the difference and are 17"" tires just bad in the snow..period?? My 2000 Maxima SE with 17"" tires is terrible..but changed to yokohama this year but no snow yet to test it out..By the way in Northeast dealers have mostly G35X in inventory,can order a regular G35 but would it be considered a white elephant in this market??  The final decision may be for me be the actual driving experience and feel,bottom line and possible better financing terms by year end for either car..Is this crazy??"

If there are remaining 2005 cars, you will get the best price on one of those."
1899,dewey,November 2005,"With an RWD vehicle, it's necessary to fit appropriate tires for a portion of the year, then use skill, driving experience and common sense the few (or not so few) days that the AWD people insist all others should stay indoors.  The nimble feel of an RWD vehicle trumps the idiot-resistant AWD vehicle every time, in my world  Completely agree ! I live in Toronto and for seven years I love driving my RWD 99 BMW 3 series twelve months a year!  I have never ever owned snow tires and still find driving RWD manageable with the exception of about two blizzard days a year! During those days I just walk a short distance to the subway and go to work! Not exactly a great inconvenience!"

1901,shipo,November 2005,"Tweaking tire pressure between front and rear ends alters the handling of the car. Add more pressure in the front and you'll reduce the amount of understeer your car will naturally display. Virtually every BMW manual I've ever taken a look at recommends anywhere from 4 to 6 psi difference between the front set and the rear set (with the rears always being the higher of the two).  Personally I've always been inclined to bump the settings a little. IIRC, I usually ran 33/39 in my 328i, 32/38 in my 530i with the summer tires, and 34/38 with my winter tires. I came up with those settings simply by driving different pressures and deciding what felt the best. Scientific? Not even a little. Did it work for me? Yup. ;-)  Best Regards, Shipo"

I am pretty darn sure that my Outback with AS performance tires will do a 20 degree hill from a stop in snow.  I assume that everyone knows that there is a difference between a 20% grade and a 20-degree grade! Percent grade refers to ""rise over run"", or basically the tangent of the angle.

I knew that, however, my guess is that that is a charitable assumption at best. ;-)  Regarding the driveways in question, two of them do in fact climb for some of their distance at ridiculous angles (well in excess of a 50% grade is my SOTP guess).  Regarding grades and regularly traveled roads, IIRC, the interstate highway system is limited to 8%, even in the most difficult to traverse areas of the Rockies and the Sierra Nevadas. Other areas vary; however, it is my understanding that most places around the country have adopted the 8% limit (as in back in the early 1960s) for all new road construction. Does that mean that steep hills are going away? Nope. Many roads are ""Grandfathered"" in, and then there is the whole driveway issue like in my neighborhood. Does that mean that there are not going to be any new roads that exceed 8%? Nope as well. Exceptions are bound to pop up here and there.  Best Regards, Shipo"

Please forgive my intrusion."
1909,designman,November 2005,"Gordon, thanks for refreshing my memory. I think I learned that in Earth Science class back in 1963. I have a degree in aeronautical engineering, but grade is an aspect that was never used in the discipline. I would guess it is used in civil engineering and architecture.  In any event, that means a 20% grade is approx. a 11.3 degree angle, and a 20-degree angle would be a 36% grade. Correct? Simple trig?  Anyway, back to my original statement. My Subie with AS performance tires will do a 20-degree grade aka 36% grade, and I believe most AWD cars in this situation can negotiate the angle as well while most two-legged cars would be floundering like fish trying to swim up a waterfall.  I am now tempted to put winter tires on my 530 and run some empirical tests with both cars. After all, this RWD/AWD debate is cyclical with no sign of letting up. And inevitably, Shipo is always right in the middle of it, fighting for truth and justice with his snowy New Hampshire anecdotes... and wisdom of course.  ;-)"
1910,fedlawman,November 2005,"I did reply with the opinion that the 200lb weight difference between the rwd g35 and awd g35x was not any big deal IMHO for street driving.  200 lbs is like me driving with my wife and 80 lbs. of landscapers bark in car. If you can't tell the difference in acceleration, handling, and ride quality, then you certainly won't notice a few more hundred pounds of an SUV. And if you don't care about fuel economy and the availabilty of a manual transmission, that's your personal preference. Many people do.  Backed up by my anecdotal 25 mpg on the highway on a recent road trip with said g35x.  Although my tongue was in my cheek, the fact remains that the 4-Runner and G35X have similar horsepower, length, wheelbase, price, and amenties. No ""anecdotal"" information there. The G35X, like the 4-Runner, forces it's owner to compromise driving dynamics for the sake of AWD.  My point is that if you live someplace where snow and ice are major forces for months out of the year, the G35X is not a panacea for 4-seasons motoring. On the other hand, if snow is merely a minor annoyance, why suffer all the AWD sacrifices year-round for just a smidge more road confidence a few days a year?  Snow tires and slower speeds are 90% of the solution for winter driving. On the days where that's not enough to get you to your destination, no AWD Sport sedan is gonna cut it."

Your tongue in cheek comparison to the 4 runner while cute, really offers nothing germane to this discussion.

My point (again) is simply that a vehicle must sacrifice measures of sport to gain measures weather capability. The G35X, while certainly more sport biased than a 4-Runner, nevertheless makes some of the same SUV sacrifices in order to offer AWD traction.

No, it has the driving dynamics of a 200 lb heavier rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry. Just because you can't tell the difference doesn't mean it isn't there.

1950,podres,December 2005,"The C230 and C350 can be had with manual transmissions.  Comparing ED BMW with US MSRP MB is silly. MB has ED as well.  I think that MB is a strangely overlooked brand in this category. It is a fine car, albeit less filled with nifty toys than its Japanese counterparts, but it is rock solid, responsive and attractively designed.  It is a contender."
1951,nyccarguy,December 2005,"I've always found the C-Class to be a handsome car. I believe you can get a C350 with a 6 speed manual. MBs reputation during the last few years does scare me a bit. The car has been around since the fall of '00 (as an '01 model). Drive the BMW and the MB back to back and see what you think is sportier. The 3 series will come out on top.  I agree with blueguydotcom. I don't care how close the 0-60mph & 1/4 miles times are between sticks and their power sucking torque converter counterpart slushboxes are, it just isn't the same driving experience-wise (div2 said it best in his ROUNDEL article a few months back).  I also understand that stick isn't for everybody."

If one looked into ED, one would know there's an ED invoice price and you build your car from that and negotiate the dealer's profit - $800-1200.  An e90 330i with the toys I want (sport, comfort access, leather) is 40.8k. ED invoice price, including 1k dealer profit: $35,645. Add in the BMWCCA rebate and it's $35,145, a 5,600 savings.

What are you talking about? Honestly, the post this is connected to doesn't seem to gel with your sudden outburst.  I did some research and found this post (5019) cdnpinhead, ""Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans"" #5019, 12 Dec 2005 6:25 pm  have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or Avant style)....The only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the BMW 3, the BMW 5 and the G35 coupe.  WTF? Maybe a 5 or 3 wagon could hold a bike. A G35 coupe? Did you try that? I can't see how that's possible given the fact the G35's trunk is tiny and it's backseat is a torture chamber.  Given that, I compromised and added the IS250 (no fold-down seat), the A4 Avant (AWD) & the A3 (front-wheel drive) to my matrix.  The A4 avant, A3 and Matrix seem realistic. Might as well go Mazda3 - better handling than the other 3 and much better manual shifter too. The IS250 simply makes no sense given your bike requirement...the backseat in the IS250/350 is a joke.  CTS...again, this seems weird with your bike requirement. FWIW, I think the CTS and IS250/350 handle like pigs.  Is this what you wanted? I've driven all the cars you mentioned (some not at wagons though)."
1963,gordonwd,December 2005,"Although it makes me cringe to actually agree with blueguy , I do agree that your list of cars is odd considering your original requirements. Especially the G35 coupe.  FWIW, I have a '04 325i sedan. I have the winter package that includes the fold-down seats, and I have carried my bicycle a number of times with the seats folded down -- it fits quite well although it helps if I pull the seat post out as well as removing the front wheel. In the winter, that built-in ski bag is really a nice feature and will hold two pairs of cross-country skis without having to fold the seats down.  One other feature notable for bicyclists (and others): the E46, at least, has built-in roof-rack mounting points. I bought a Thule rack made especially for this car, so when my wife and I are going somewhere together to ride, it just takes a few short minutes to put the rack on with both bikes. I'm not sure if the E90 has these mounts -- it's not something that's listed in the brochures and I even owned the car for a while before I discovered them!"

1966,brightness04,December 2005,"Looking back on the posts, if you were trying to suggest that folks who live in states who determine taxes by MSRP take it on the chin by acquiring high value cars...I guess they do.  The key is not ""high value"" but inflated MSRP. e.g. two cars, both selling for $38k or leasing for $550/mo . . . they have the same ""value,"" but if one has an MSRP of $55k and the other's is $40k, there is a significant difference in the tax due despite the identical market price. It's the same reason why I hate large mail-in rebates at local retailers; the consumers end up paying much higher sales tax rate."

1970,sosk,January 2006,"Hi---- I'm 50-ish & a recent empty nester. I typically keep a car around 10-12 years. Have had Buick sedans but am now ready for a bit of fun. I mostly drive 12 miles a day, straight down 1 street to work & back (boring, I know!), with a little more driving over the weekend.  I was looking hard at '04 & '05 BMW 330i's. Loved the drive but thought the interior lacked some of the pleasantries that most all cars have these days, even my '95 Buick!  I LOVE the exterior of the G35 coupe and thought it was really fun to drive, but it seemed so noisy when I sat in the back seat.  Now I'm looking hard at the Lexus IS250, and I like it a LOT. I've also looked at an Acura TSX. I really am trying to stay in a smaller car, no longer than the TSX's 183"".  Anyone have any other ideas as to what I should look at?"
1971,cdnpinhead,January 2006,"Check out the Cadillac CTS & the Mercedes C230. With those included, your shopping list will look much like mine.  If you're buying something soon & don't want a manual transmission (which I do), give the Lincoln LS a look.

My limit is 188"", due to my garage, so length is one of the first dimensions I check.  I guess it depends on your definition of luxury: are you looking for a ""luxury"" nameplate, or just ""luxurious"" amenities, like leather and power everything?  In addition to the Mercedes C-class and BMW 3-series, the Volvo S40 and Audi A3 would meet your size requirement. I personally would be concerned with the reliability of those options and would lean more toward your choices from Lexus and Acura. If you're willing to do a coupe, you may want to look at the RSX, too.  If you just want leather and other goodies, you may want to consider a Mazda 3, a Subaru Impreza or a Saab 9-2X (which is basically a gussied-up Impreza). Each of these can be had with leather, sunroof, upgraded audio, etc., while still meeting your length requirement.  If a shorter length is truly a requirement you may also want to consider a small SUV (I know, it's probably blasphemy here and probably belongs on a different forum, but)--several choices would meet your requirement and add cargo capacity, too.  My two cents: the IS250 is absolutely, hands down the most attractive car on the list!  Best of luck and happy car hunting.  Greg"
1975,sosk,January 2006,"Hi Greg--  It IS a challenge finding something under 183""! I guess I can go larger; I just don't want to - my car now is 193"" & I just like the smaller ones. I don't care about a luxury nameplate - I just like the amenities, like leather & xenon lights & maybe the built-in garage door opener, and I want illuminated radio controls on my steering wheel (my old Buick has those but my hubby's new Maxima's are not illuminated). I just can't do an SUV!!  I haven't driven the Volvo S40 yet but I will - it looks kinda cute! My ex-brother-in-law just retired from being pretty high up at Ford & he told me to stay away from the Volvo! He recommends the IS.  I didn't like the dash on the Saab 9-3, but I'll surf now & look at the 9-2x you mentioned, as well as the Mazda & Subaru.  I looked at the RSX but felt it was a little too bare-bones for me. The TSX is probably just right for me, but the looks of the IS just make me drool!  My dad had a Hona Prelude a hundred years ago - i wish they still made that! Actually I'd REALLY like to find a ""fake"" '55 - '57 TBird that is a ""modern"" car under the shell!  Susan"

One thing about a BMW, especially the 3 series, is the way the interior is put together doesn't actually become obvious until you live with the car a while.

They are not considered a luxury brand (but aspire to be one) but a very solid car, and the GT is quite powerful/fun to drive. Main issues for me were subpar gas mileage, smaller backseat, and design was a little on the plain side (although tasteful and simple.)  This was my second choice to the Acura TL, TL was a better value proposition to me (even though it cost more), I liked the design, features, back seat room, etc... Snow was not an issue in my purchase though.  Luxury is a bit of a tough word to me now because non-luxury cars are more and more incorporating features that are generally considered luxury. Look at a full loaded Accord V6 with Nav vs. Acura TL or Lexus ES and you will see what I mean.

The difference has to do with such arcane things as inter-axle & limited-slip differentials.  I'm guessing you couldn't care less. AWD is automatic and is generally the best choice for those who are mostly concerned with highway traction (as opposed to off-road stuff). Subaru is the reigning king of this, but if you want ""luxury"" (however you define it -- there's lots of bickering potential here), the BMW & Audi options are good ones, and some are willing to admit that the Infiniti G can play too. I've spent quite a bit (but not nearly enough) of my life in Colorado, and I can assure you that the most common vehicle driven by locals in the ""high country"" (above 8000 feet -- say Winter Park/Fraser/Granby) is the Subaru.  Audi has been doing this longer than anyone, and has the best (bar none) interiors in the business.

2003,nybmwguy,January 2006,"Here is a provactive comment. There are essentially two cars in this segment to buy from. All others are a waste unless you get an incredible deal. Agree or disagree?  1. BMW 3 series.  Price the 325xi to a comparable Mercecedes C240 or Audi A4 2.0 and you find best value for what it offers (especially with new maintenance program that effectively brings the price down a bit more and if you opt for leatherette in price comparison). I like Audi, but not discounted sufficiently for its poorer record in quality and lower resale value. Comparably equipped car is only slightly cheaper and not worth the savings. Audi and Mercedes don't have a single attribute over the 3 series in this category (though i prefer E o4 A6 to 5 series and S or A8 to 7-series).  2. Acura TL.  It is a blah car, but great quality, power and interior. No option pricing, reliable, reasonably stylish. G35 was ""the"" other car in this segment, but I can't see what the G35 has over the new TL and again, the TL is close in price so why go Inifiniti (If you love Infiniti beg, borrow and steal to get into the M35).  Volvo S60 - not comparable, underpowered, weaker quality, image, etc. Saab 93 - nice, but a level under and comparable to a TSX. Lexus I350 - not fun, cheap looking interior (to me), nothing compelling Infiniti G35 - Buy the TL for same power and nicer quality (G35 coupe would be an exception for this rule if you are coupe person) Audi A4- again, buy the 3 series for slightly more and make it back in service coverage, resale value and quality (also, interior is great quality, but seems dated). BMW now has a reasonably proficient 4wheel drive system so quatro less key. Mercedes C- too expensive, too many cut corners. Buy the E used or go for the BMW. Cadillac - not a bad car, but not compelling. Not cheap enough Lincolen Zephyr - same price as ANY of the above and weaker than all of them."
2004,shipo,January 2006,"""I can't see what the G35 has over the new TL...""  Ummm, how about RWD vs. FWD. That's a big one in my book, big enough that if I had to choose between these two, I'd pick the Infiniti.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2005,nybmwguy,January 2006,"Good point, but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 (just go leatherette) and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight distribution.....  I live in a snow belt and drive a 328 in snow with traction control, but I have not been as impressed with the G35 in bad weather and at the limits. So I'd go TL though before the new one was out I might have gone G35x and had the best of both worlds (love that car, just don't like the interior quality)."
2006,shipo,January 2006,"My point was only comparing the G35 and the TL, if you want to throw BMW into the mix, then I'd certainly choose that instead of either of the other two. BTW, with the BMW I would much rather get a RWD SP version and winter tires as opposed to the ""xi"" (which is how I set my 530i up for the snow we get around here). Year round performance, what's not to like? :shades:  Best Regards, Shipo"
2007,sosk,January 2006,"Hi from Dallas. I've been driving a Regal Grand Sport (FWD) for 13 years and am finally ready for a new car! Everything I like is RWD. Being in Dallas I obviously don't need to concern myself with snow issues, but I do want to feel comfortable in wet conditions & the occasional icy drive home from work. I like the IS, G35 & 330i. I'm a 50-ish female with a light foot, pretty much just drive back & forth to work (7 miles each way) & not much highway driving. Do you think I'll be ok with a RWD? Thanks."
2008,mnrep2,January 2006,"Good point, but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 (just go leatherette) and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight distribution.....  Why would anyone give up almost 2 seconds 0-60 MPH, class leading interior space, Tractor like traction with the awd, rwd biased handling in normal traction situations and, luxury touches like keyless igntion, and reclining rear seating? That's why I drive the G35x"
2009,kdshapiro,January 2006,Because the new 3 series is the class leader?
2010,pearl,January 2006,"Yes, you'll be fine with RWD, even north of Dallas. Just remember that when the weather is bad (rain, snow, ice, etc) just drive like there is an egg under your brake and accelerator pedals. Easy does it - AND - KEEP MOVING! Sometimes you can't avoid it, but try to gauge traffic, and if the roads are slick, try to drive so that you don't actually come to a full stop. I live in the north, have never put snowtires/chains on my cars and have never been stuck. If it is really horrible, don't go out, otherwise drive carefully and remember that just because you can go doesn't automatically mean you can stop (for all you four wheel drivers). In your part of the country, I would say buy anthing you want, just don't try to drive like crazy if/when the weather gets bad."
2011,sosk,January 2006,"PEARL, thanks for the tips! I usually don't go out when the weather is terrible; usually it's a question of getting home when they let us leave work early because of ice. That happens maybe 1 day a year here. My speed-demon days are over (wish I still had my '71 Mustang!). So I think I WILL get what I want & not make FWD a criteria."
2012,gordonwd,January 2006,"I agree that the RWD decision is a non-issue in Dallas. I mean, if you can't drive an RWD car safely year-round in Dallas, where could you drive one? After all, I'm up here in Detroit and am doing just fine with a 325i on all-season tires. Go for the Bimmer!"
2013,vchiu,January 2006,">But I have to disagree with remark regarding inline six limitations.  Sorry, I wasn't clear enough. I heard that BMW would need to fully redesign a block to make it 3.5 L instead of 3.0. the current 3.0 comes from successive evolutions from the original 2.5 to 2.8 then 3.0. Should a 3.5 be redeveloped, the overall block length increase would compromise crash test ratings, so it seems 3.0 is a limitation difficult to overcome in this context. If BMW want to switch to v6, increasing displacement will be easier, and this is what MB did.  but straight 6 have some advantages that V6 don't have (balance), so I prefer straight 6 myself.  Because of this, BMW may directly switch to V8 for their top end."
2014,shipo,January 2006,"""the current 3.0 comes from successive evolutions from the original 2.5 to 2.8 then 3.0.""  Ummm, no. The previous generation of I6 from BMW was as you describe, however, the I6 that is in the 2006 (and later) E60s and all E90s is an all new design that came out of the gates at three liters. I've never known BMW to design a new engine that didn't have the ability to grow the displacement.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2015,brightness04,February 2006,"I said: The key is not ""high value"" but inflated MSRP  Your response: You're splitting hairs. Inflated MSRP implies a value judgement. Buying a car is a value judgment, the price is the price. It costs what it costs to you the consumer.  No personal value judgement was implied in my use of the term ""inflated MSRP"" at all. ""Inflated MSRP"" means an MSRP that is far higher than actual market clearing price. For example:  MB E class with $5-7k manufacturer lease incentive, that indicates an inflated MSRP.  Another example: both TL and 9-5 sell for about $31-32k in the market place; they are by definition comparable in ""value."" Yet, one of them has an MSRP of $39k, whereas the other is around $34k. The $5k difference is sheer ""inflated MSRP"" that does not accrue at all in terms of ""value."" In more than half of the 50 states, the inflated MSRP gets taxed every year of a car's ownership."
2016,kdshapiro,February 2006,The price is the price. I don't buy your example of junk economics. You pay what you pay. I can't believe this dead horse is still being beaten.
2017,pat,February 2006,Let's stop beating it ...  Can we move on?
2018,vchiu,February 2006,"If you say so, then no problem. We will see if it works out this way  but why don't BMW add a turbo like they did for the earliest 745? I am dreaming of this six in line with a compressor or a turbo with minimum lag. If BMW added some direct fuel injection, they could even improve economy like Volkswagen did for the 2.0 TFSI. 300 HP, 280 LBF, this would make an interesting offer. Alpina does this but we need to go for the 4.4 V8 (516LBF, a real delight on 5 or 7series)"
2019,dhamilton,February 2006,"The comparison that Edmunds did on the A4 vs 330 is almost completely different from the recent road&track comparo. I know they are comparing two different cars in the bimmer catagory but if you look at just numbers, and the fact that the A4 for road&track was equipped with far better tires, it would seem as though the A4 stacks up a little better, than Edmunds would make out. {actually a whole lot better} Granted the tires are a huge issue and you can go so far as test {track }conditions to forgive the big disparity. That's why it's best to drive cars for yourself and make your own judgments. One other point is that IMO Audi has a key ingredient that BMW lacks. That being a certain driver friendly something where you can drive an Audi all day and never get beat up. They are much more forgiving as a GT car IMO Also sosk, I live in Houston where we probably get more rain but much less ice. A good set of tires for the appropriate season will go a long ways on any car. That, with adjusting driving habits when the weather turns foul should keep you safe Finally, I recommend driving as many of the cars in your ""needs"" category as possible to see which one fits you best. I would recommend a Japanese brand if you intend to keep the car for 13 years as you did your last one. Good luck and let us know how you do."
2020,qbrozen,March 2006,"Since you quoted him, I didn't think it necessary. If the quote you pulled wasn't representative of your argument ... well, let's just say you might want to be more careful and direct in the future to avoid confusion. No harm done."

2022,shipo,March 2006,"Assumption: When you say, ""I need a car that will handle well on bad roads as I live in the upper midwest."" What you are really saying is, ""I need a car that can absorb rough roads and pot holes without destroying wheels and tires.  I would think that either would be sufficient, assuming of course that you don't opt for the Sport Package on the A4 2.0T (which has the same rubber as does the A4 3.2). It all rests with the amount of distance between the rim and the tread. Consider the following:  Audi A4 3.2: Tire: 235/45 R17 -- Sidewall height: 4.20"" BMW 325i & xi: Tire: 205/55 R16 -- Sidewall height: 4.44"" Audi A4 2.0T: Tire: 215/55 R16 -- Sidewall height: 4.66""  As you can see, the non-SP version of the A4 2.0T has the greatest side wall height while the narrower tread of the 325i will allow it to cut through the snow better. Which one is the best? If you want AWD and a true SP, then your only option is the A4.  Best Regards, Shipo"

Audi's are getting killed in reliability ratings lately. Are you committed to an entry-level luxury sedan? Those w/ low profile tires & billed as ""great handling"" will almost certainly provide a rough ride in upper midwest roads (i.e. pothole city).

Any 3-Series or A4, even without the Sport Package will be able to run rings around an MDX. Geez, I cannot even in my weirdest dreams (nightmares actually) imagine cross shopping an MDX with either of the two German sedans meade is looking at.  Thought #2, maybe meade is looking for a sedan that has a manual transmission, that in and of itself would rule out an MDX.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2025,mradel,March 2006,"I just traded my 4 year old 325xi in for a A4 Cabriolet. That is Audi's 3.0 AWD convertable. I believe that I may trade my loyalty to Audi for good. I also have a BMW X3. The A4 did go for $50K but it is a solid, luxurious performance vehical. A big reason for the trade is that I was tired of taking the BMW to the shop. The 325xi had recently developed rattles in the back seat that prevented me from driving it or being a passenger. I love the A4! Many things seem ""smarter"" in the Cabriolet. The transmission is a fancy multitronic breed and is very nice. Many of the techno features seem better. The luxury inside is more plush in the Audi. Have yet to see how it is in four years, however many reviews out there point at this model as being a solid value."

BTW - trunk volume of the TL is only 12.5 cubic feet compared with 14.8 for the G35 (330i is 12.0) so I could argue that the G35 is overall (passenger plus trunk) a larger car than the TL with a much smaller turning radius.  The TL is at a disadvantage in terms of maneuverability because of its front wheel drive design....not trying to reopen the front-vs-rear debate.  I think that the TL is a great overall car. I find myself in parking lots/garages fairly frequently so turning radius mades a difference to me. There are obviously good and bad points for all cars....turning radius is a bad point for the TL."
2053,blueguydotcom,March 2006,I heard that the 335i will be sold solely as a coupe/convertible. If that is the case then I am not interested in the 335i.  It would be the 335ci then. I don't buy that for an instant. The i has been in need of a powerful sedan version since the e46 changeover. BMW screwed sedan drivers with the e46 M3. An e90 M3 sedan would be great but far too many people make an ignorant connection between 2 doors and sports cars v. 4 door cars. I'd much rather the stiffer chassis of a sedan and the framed window glass over the flexible design of the coupe and it's lousy window design.

2056,dewey,March 2006,"My bad, I meant 335ci.  BMW is being presumptious not only in their connections between sport and two doors but also with non-sport and touring wagons.  If there was a BMW 330xi Touring or even better a 330i Touring (prefer rwd), I would have one in my garage right now. Unfortunately BMW only sells 325xi Touring and 530xi Touring wagons. Not my idea of excitement at all.  Or how about the 1 series hatchback wagon? Nope not here folks, we are going to have to settle for a 1 series coupe.  Shame, shame BMW! At least Audi caters to seekers who want more sport in their wagons by selling A4 3.2 and S4 Avants and ofcourse the A3 Quattro."
2057,potemkin,March 2006,"""It would be the 335ci then.""  Rumor has it that BMW is dropping the ""c"" designation.

2063,primetime79,May 2006,"Let me preface my post by unequivocally stating the mere facts. I am not an automobile professional. I have no loyalty to any automobile manufacturer. I enjoy a exhilirating driving experience.  Three years ago (2003), I was in the market for a sedan that had a certain level of sport and luxury. I narrowed my search to four cars. 1.) BMW 330I 2.) Audi A4 1.8T 3.) Lexus Is 300 4.) Infinity G 35 . Quickly this search was down to two as the Lexus IS 300 had absolutely nothing to offer in the form a luxury offering and the Infinity was much of the same although not to Lexus extreme. The ""feel"" of the steering wheel and all other components of the Inifity made it quite apparent that the build quality of this car was not up to par. So it was down to two cars, The BMW 330I and the Audi A4 1.8T. The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4. Maybe it's me, but the 330I was not impressive at all. I felt like it was a regular family sedan. I have nothing against BMW, but sometimes I wonder if sometimes their maybe a little bit of brainwashing or speaking something to existent, with the over hyped driving (handling) experience. For me it came down to the getting the best car for ME. The A4 exemplified te best handling (feedback), the best interior. The build quality on this car was impeccable.  Unfortunately due to circumstance beyond my control (wife) I had to trade in my Audi a year ago for a SUV. Fast forward to the present, and I have been blessed to make the same purchase decision again. Again it came down to the eact same 4 cars with a little thought given to the Acura TSX. But after a close up encounter with the TSX , while the car is a phenomenal value it was apparent is was nothing more than that a ""phenomenal value"". So i test drove the same 4 cars again. The Infinity now with the 6MT was a nice car but lacked in the same area interior refinement and the short throw clutch felt like my brothers 95 Mitsubishi Eclipse (cheap). Next on the list was the Audi. The new Audi A4 had undergone some minor changes most notably HP improvement. Overall the car was better than the one I once had, but suprisingly was 6k more similiarly equipped. This posed a problem.  It was then down to two cars the IS 350 and the 330I. Lots of people do not like the new 330I exterior. But I think while it may not be a sporty as the IS per se, it is definielty more profounding and unique. As usual when I went for my test drive of the BMW i walked into the dealership and was treated as an outkast. I guess this car either sells itself, or I did not look like the typical BMW client ready to make a purchase. In my usual car shopping attire I wore shorts, flip flops and a white wife-beater shirt with my bling bling on. Finally someone came to help me and I was in the BMW 330I. First glance of the 330I interior I did know what to think. After 30 seconds of looking at it, this understated interior started looking growingly bland. Once on the road, I could not figure out what all this Hoopla was about. Immediately I went straight to Lexus dealership to figure out what changes Lexus made to the IS. At first glance I fell in love with it's beauty. I then told the sales person order me a black on black with navi, but it has to be manual. It was at that time my heart was broken. No manual for 350. Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history. I am a proud owner of a IS 350 Crystal White Navi. This car is not only super quick but handles excellent. I have driven it several times with the VDIM off and it makes a huge difference. Around corners with the VDIM on it cuts the throttle to quickly. I must advise the average driver to be careful, because this is a RWd car and they tend to spin out rather quickly. But after two weeks of owning it I am extremely ecstatic about my decision. I personally think BMW might be overhyped, Audi are underpowered, Infiiniti are built with less interior refinement and overall build quailty. Lexus Is 350 for me at least is the perfect blend, if you do not want to buy the car do not test drive it!!!!!!!!!  p.s sorry I am a little long winded"
2064,pgsmith,May 2006,"My experience @ BMW was similar. Obviously I did not conform to their image of a BMW owner having worn a t-shirt and shorts into their showroom. They wasted no time in regaling stories of who they knew when I explained where I worked (Ho-hum, I was there to see the vehicles). After we spent (too much) time in the the salesman's cubicle, I learned they did not have a car with the equipment they learned I might be wanting, but they would happily order it for me.  I said great, but I wanted to actually drive a car to see if the car was really what I would like. I was told that: 1. They did not even have a car that had an automatic (wife's requirement, not mine) I could test drive (which I saw later the same day on the lot). :confuse: 2. They would not let me test drive a red car since I was not interested in red and that would put miles on a car someone else would buy. :confuse: 3. They had a blue one waiting to be prepped. When I indicated that it might be OK to accept blue, The vehicle was not prepped even within a week, at which point I had to ""make them"" let me test drive the red one. :confuse:  End results: 1. I was offended by their arrogance. :mad: 2. I was not very impressed by the vehicle. 3. I bought a competitors vehicle (C280), which I am happy with. 4. I will continue to vehicle shop in the future in shorts, jeans, t-shirts, flip-flops, running shoes, as this will help me decide about they ability of the dealership to be confident in the car not try to sell the ""image"". 5. I will leave immediately any dealer who gives me this type of treatment in the future."
2065,redsoxgirl,May 2006,"I respect your right to have the opinion that the IS350 is the right car for you, but I strongly disagee that it is even close to the ""best luxury/sport sedan"" on any objective basis.  Clearly you have a different definition of ""sport"" than I do as it pertains to how a car accelerates, handles, steers, brakes, performs - as well as how connected to the road and driver it is. As evidence:  The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4.  How anyone could conclude the ""handling prowess"" of a 60/40 imbalanced FWD A4 is superior to that of the 50/50 balanced RWD 330i is an enigma. Are you sure you weren't overly enamored with the interior of the A4 to forget to put it through a serious test drive against the 330i?  Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history.  Again, perhaps having come out of a 170 hp A4, you were enamored with the 300+ hp IS350. But that automatic transmission removes any ""sport"" there might have been in the car for me. Sorry, drag racing doesn't fit my driving style.  I have never owned a BMW and I am not sure I ever will. But in searching for a compact to mid size sport sedan to replace my Boxster S this fall, the IS350 doesn't make the long list, let alone the short list on the ""sport"" criteria. Great little luxury car, perhaps. True sport sedan compared to the 3-series, no way. At least not for me."
2066,primetime79,May 2006,Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth. The car has excellent steering feel. My only complaint is the VDIM killing the throttle to early when the wheel starts losing traction. I guess I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.
2067,redsoxgirl,May 2006,"Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth.  Yes, I've driven the IS350. My cousins own a Lexus dealership and they will sell me one (or any Lexus model) for their cost, so I had hoped to like it. The IS350 is a decent automatic. But it's an automatic. It's probably better than BMW steptronic, comparable to the Mercedes/AMG ""manumatic"" and not as good as the Porsche tiptronic. And I would never own one of those. I wouldn't even be happy with the BMW M3 ""SMG"" transmission. It's not an ""objective"" performance thing for me, it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment. If you are enough of a ""driver"" to have tested the limits of the VDIM and don't like that interference, I am surprised you don't agree, but that's your perogative.  I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.  I think your curiosity stems from thinking that 2 or 3 objective performance measures capture the entire essence of driving feel and enjoyment - and even true performance - for everybody. Gross oversimplification. As a management consultant, I spend 60 hours a week boiling down complex business strategy and financial issues to a few spreadsheets, graphs and Power Point slides. But at the end of the day, I can immediately tell you what executives ""get it"" and what ones don't, by how much they go behind the numbers rather than focus on them. So the last thing I'm going to do is pick my next car by looking in the back of Car and Driver or Road and Track at a bunch of statistics without spending a lot of time in the drivers seat froming my own subjective opinions."
2068,primetime79,May 2006,"Apparently we have a few things in common as I too am a financial/management professional (Senior Investment Analyst). I honestly felt exactly the same way you did about automatics before I test drove the IS 350. This is the first automatic I have ever owned. The reason I don't have any significant issues with the VDIM is because it only comes into play when I feel like driving the car to it's limit (2% of the time). And besides as I mentioned you can easily turn it off in 15 seconds by starting the car with the parking brakes then tapping the brakes twice then the park brakes twice then the brakes twice. This takes no more than 15 seconds.I love my 350 dearly, however my first choice would have been the M3 if I was only patient enough to wait for the new M3 to come out."
2069,cdnpinhead,May 2006,"It's not just BMW.  I was put off, long-term, five years ago when I stopped in at a Lexus store during my lunch break. I didn't come in wearing flip-flops or a t-shirt, but endured indifferent treatment all the same.  Even if the I250/350 was worthy (which it isn't, for me), I'd think (at least) twice about ever darkening the doorstep of a Lexus dealer again.  I'm sure most are better.  Mine, here in Phoenix, wasn't. That Lexus service thing is something I read about -- I certainly didn't experience it."
2070,neko608,May 2006,"I don't think it has anything to do with the make, but it's all about the dealership. I went to Motorwerks BMW and Woodfield Lexus (both in Chicago area) and they were all great."
2071,v_lad,May 2006,"I was searching for a sedan in 30-35k price range recently and got to test drive lexus. The dealer talked me into trying automatic (i was very surprised they don't have manual with this engine). After getting into it I saw nice pad-shifters and was prepared for a good impression. But after a minute a realized that you can't control CURRENT gear of your car - you only limit your MAXIMUM gear. you don't even know the gear that's currently on! My current automatic Subaru Legacy(165hp) is more sportier in that aspect (it always shows the actual gear that's on). I can't say anything about handling - I simply hadn't got that far with a test drive. It's a luxury, but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers. Someone at Lexus should be fired for that type of design."
2072,blueguydotcom,May 2006,"Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth.  And molasses slow. Try a double downshift at 65 with the tranny in 6th. That move - i'd really go triple most of the time - takes 5 seconds in the IS350. It was excrutiating. I wanted power...the computer didn't want to give it to me.  The car has excellent steering feel.  If you like numb, then yes, it's excellent. If you want to feel the road through the wheel, the IS350 is too isolated.  I guess I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.  Because they like to drive. I find the e90's exterior bland. Doesn't matter...I don't buy for how it looks on the outside. The interior's okay - but it's not driver centric enough. The place where the e90 shines against the current competition - balance, handling, driver-feedback. Driving, there's no other sport sedan that feels the same right now. Or better. Bummer. At 140+ on the autobahn my e90 feels buttoned down and lets me know everything going on. That makes the car worth owning.  Drive the Is350 hard and it becomes really clear it's not a sport sedan. It's a luxury cruiser with a big engine.  The 07 G35 may finally be some competition for the 330i. Of course the 07 335i with 300 hp and 300 ft-lbs of torque from 1400-5000rpm will be hard to be in any fashion."
2073,fedlawman,May 2006,"""it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment.  From your posts I can see you are a descriminating enthusiast who wants a sports car experience wrapped in a luxury sedan body.  Take another look at the sedans in this ""entry-lux"" class - they weigh 3500 lbs and have so much active/passive safety equipment that they practically drive themselves.  In my opinion, the car you are looking for doesn't exist."
2074,corvettefan427,May 2006,What do you all think of the Cadillac CTS?
2075,laurasdada,May 2006,"Having never driven one because of the following, imho:  Credit to Caddy for beginning to define/redefine itself with the CTS. However, the overdone, unattractive exterior and cheap looking, disjointed in design interior along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time I encountered the CTS. Now, I may be missing a great ride, but I truly enjoy a nicely styled exterior and an interior that suits me is a must. While the interior does not have to be of the ultimate in materials, I do want a logical and attractive layout (as a reference, Audi and Lexus do interiors right in my book) as, of course, that is where I spend my time driving. The CTS (which may have been upgraded since last I looked?) I found quite lacking, especially given the asking price. But, I find all Cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices. Hence rebates and ""Employee Pricing...""  I chose the Acura TL as FWD is not a four letter word to me. I grew up with FWD (Saab, Honda, Mitsu, Renault!, VW...) and appreciate the snow country advantage (New Englnader & avid skier). I believe that Honda/Acura produces the best handling FWDs out there (and I know some RWD afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron!) which suits me just fine. I may lose out to RWD at 9 or 10/10ths, but that is really just not an issue to me. In my comparison shopping, the TL offered the best combo of style, luxury, sport, economy, power and value.  Maybe the next CTS will be a more suitable candidate."
2076,corvettefan427,May 2006,"The new CTS should address the current models interior. Based on spy photos I've seen, and a review I read from a journalist who saw the car and described the interior as outstanding. As far as the exterior, if you don't like Caddy's styling theme, you probably still won't like the new one, although I think now that the styling has been introduced, it may be slightly more ''organic'' for 2008, although it's hard to tell."
2077,shipo,May 2006,"I've seen all of the spy shots and artistic renditions that have come out and, so far at least, the new CTS is a non-starter for me. Is it better than the original? I suppose, although that is kind of like asking who is better, Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2078,davids5,May 2006,"I am not sure that most people are on the same page here. Most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is. Working for the USAF in Europe, active duty and civilian duty I feel that I have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is. have almost 23 years of driving experience in Europe and 20 of them in Germany.To me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races,probably most of these so called sport sedans are not even equipped with the proper tires for high speed sporty driving. While most Americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport sedans and wagens and think 80mph is fast when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over here.You dont see American Ford, GM,Honda,Toyota,etc burning up the track.Many ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high speed and sport vehicles like MB,BMW,Audi-VW (VAG)and of course Porsche.I feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirens,dodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true performance and true longevity of a vehicle. I dont give a damn if one car has a better DVD-CD changer than the other car or has 20 cup holders.Our American car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high powered engines that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hog.Off base here in Germany a gallon of gas cost $6.86.They build powerfull engines over here that use very little gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction......"
2079,redsoxgirl,May 2006,"Sorry, but after another test drive late yesterday, I am even more convinced the IS350 is not for me.  In my opinion, if Lexus were serious about ""sport"" they would have a manaul 6-speed or at least fast shifting SMG. Blueguydotcom is right, this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time.  But even with a manual transmission, I still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from BMW. I hate to say it - because I don't like the car - but the G35 was better in that regard.  Lastly, re-read your ""15 second solution"" to overly interfering VDIM. Porsche has a button. BMW has a button. This is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their ""sport"" marketing with the real thing.  The Lexus IS350 is a nice car for someone other than me."
2080,dhanley,May 2006,"No sweat. I've made statements i've had to retract lots of times.  There are some options on the infiniti that you can't get on the 300C. And, doubtlessly the infiniti interior will be higher quality. Just saying that power and economy and the majority of features aren't really differentiating factors. And, it is impressive to me that chrysler puts that thumping pushrod v8 in a car (390 lb-ft!) and matches infinti's mpg. Heck, a subaru legacy GT gets 19/25 with it's 2.5T and manual tranny.  I'm not too big on bose, but i'd have to hear the systems back to back to judge. The stereo in my (aging) bmw sucks. My old saab SE (harmon-kardon) was much better. A good sterio is on my list of must-haves for the next davemobile.  As for my choosing between these two cars and the 8K price diff, my preferences run to stick shift & smaller & sportier. I've been considering boxster vs z4.  Maybe if i needed to haul things i might consider a mangum?  dave"
2081,esfoad,May 2006,One other thing no one's talked about. Resale values. I'd wager that the Infiniti will hold it's value much better than the 300.
2082,billyperks1,May 2006,I think BlueGuy put the nail in the coffin- the gas mileage was horrible for my driving stlye.  I will still keep it on the short list for now.

2084,laurasdada,May 2006,"Being a happy 300M owner, I was looking forward to the next iteration. When I first saw the 300, I was just beside myself. What had they done!!! Like you, though, once I saw one up close and personal it wasn't as horrific as it appeared in the initial pix. But still not my cup, either.  But, props to DCX for being bold. I mean, look at the Ford 500...!"
2085,dhanley,May 2006,"""One other thing no one's talked about. Resale values. I'd wager that the Infiniti will hold it's value much better than the 300.""  Hard to say. A 300c awd 36-month residual is 58% right now. The m35x's 36-month resudual is 56%. Of course these are mfgr leases, so these values may not be 100% real world, but i doubt they are willing to take a bath, either."
2086,esfoad,May 2006,"Interesting that Chrysler has the residual so high. Maybe they are hoping that the car will keep the interest of the public and therefore the value. Unfortunately, Detroit vehicles, whether good or not just don't have the desireability of foreign cars, new or used. At least not yet. I hope for Chrysler that they are right."

The interior looks more upscale also, and doesn't look like pieces of choppy plastic. I have also heard that the sound system is going to be excellent with its own hard drive. see here : http://www.engadget.com/2006/04/17/2007-infiniti-g35-gets-in-dash-with-drive-and- -cf/  Technology is going upscale for this entry-level lux/sport sedan...

Anyway the new Sedan will be ready to purchase this November and you can guarantee you will see me in the line.  Also the new G35 Coupe will be available next May I believe, so I will have to squeeze one of them into my budget also, as long as it looks similar to the photos here - http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/naias_2006/0602_infiniti_g35_coupe_conce- pt/  So what are your opinions on these redesigned G's ?"

2090,kdshapiro,May 2006,"""Technology is going upscale for this entry-level lux/sport sedan""  Putting a hard drive in the car for the radio means Infiniti is cruising ahead of it's competitors? I'm interested in innovations that make the car drive better, faster, smarter...not the subwoofers."
2091,ivorypearlg,May 2006,"I think that Infiniti gives there automobiles technology to make them drive better, faster, smarter, and safer. Although they might not be inventing these features they still are featuring them in there cars. Such as Active Head Restraints ( Thank Saab for that ).. Rear Active Steer ( Porsche ? ) ... And many other things... One thing the G class will have is the VQ35DE which was on Ward's best engines since 2002 ( Since it's first inception )... I don't know, but I own a 03' G35 Coupe and the car does drive better, faster, and looks sexier then the 3 Series... Of course that just my opinion ....

2093,ivorypearlg,May 2006,"I'm sorry but I don't recall saying that the Infiniti G35 was safer then the 3 Series, just that Infiniti features items that make the car safer, and so on...

2097,kdshapiro,May 2006,"""Can you read ?"" ""I think that Infiniti gives there automobiles technology to make them drive better, faster, smarter, and safer""  That's exactly what you said. Faster, smarter, and safer than what?  As far as Saabs, I only said the IS and 3 series earned a top pick as did the Saab. For me, the IIHS top pick means all the cars in that list are safer than other midsize, and I wouldn't pick a Saab over BMW because the rear only got an acceptable vs good. That for the most part would not make a Saab safer overall. It would be the active features, passive features and overall handling, combined with crash test ratings that would make a BMW safer. The BMW would run rings around the Saab, as would the Infiniti. Being able to make an emergency maneuver with confidence is just as important as surviving a crash.  In answer to your question, check my profile."
2098,billyperks1,May 2006,You are asking KD if he owns a Bimmer? That has to be a rhetorical question.
2099,gordonwd,May 2006,"Some years back, I took part in a marketing ""focus group"" session to discuss AWD vehicles. Everyone drove a different vehicle, from me with an A4 Quattro to people with Subarus, SUVs, etc. (we found out afterward that the study was commissioned by Subaru, and their people were observing our session).  Anyway, when the subject of safety came up, I was really appalled to hear people say things like ""my wife and I both totalled out our cars last year..."", and the general focus was on all the safety equipment. When I was asked if I felt that AWD contributed to safety, I responded that ""the best way to survive an accident is not to have the accident in the first place"", and I went on to say that I felt AWD to be a safety advantage in allowing me to more easily steer around a situation or otherwise maintain control. The others mostly just stared at me...  After the session finished, some of the observers came in to chat informally. One of them came up to me and said ""I can tell that you are the motorcycle rider in the group since you're the only one who talked about safety in terms of avoidance instead of survival!"" He was entirely correct about that, and I took it as a definite compliment. My A4 has turned into a 325i now, but I still consider the handling responsiveness of the car to be one of its primary safety features."
2100,primetime79,May 2006,I actually test drove the 3301 and the M3. I am truly in love with the M3. personally I think it is the best car in the planet. The 330i was very disappointing. Couple reasons I did not choose the M3 was the fact that a new model was coming out and it did not offer the luxury refinement that would appease my spouse for a car in this price range. Maybe the only reason it felt slow was because I test drove the IS 350 hours before.....
2101,kdshapiro,May 2006,"""Maybe the only reason it felt slow was because I test drove the IS 350 hours before""  I can understand why it felt slow...it can get to 60 in under 5 secs. :confuse The M3 will run rings around most cars especially the IS350, it is not meant to be a Lexus it is meant to be a BMW, which is why the level of luxury is different by design than on the IS350.  At any rate, you vote with your dollars and after all your opinion *is* your opinion."
2102,lovemyclk,May 2006,"""So please no more mountain, curvy, wavy road nonsense.""  And please, no more 0-60 nonsense! Why not a Subie WRX STi or Lancer Evolucion? Gee, they don't have the requisite levels of luxury, but sure are a kick to drive (fast)! Also cheaper to purchase than a 330i or IS350. There are enough options for today's buyer to purchase any narrow profile of vehicle they choose. What ever is best for you is what you park in your garage.  BMW's are built by people who relish driving fast. BTW, just wondering... what are acceptable performance stats to you?

As many others have pointed out, you are overemphasizing the importance of straight line acceleration to overall performance and driving satisfaction, at least among the demographic that has graduated from stop light racing. You can strap rockets to a soap box and get it to 60 faster than a Ferrari.  BMW's philosophy has always been ""make the sespension faster than the car"". If you don't buy that ""nonsense"" then GM and Ford have lots of cars just for you.  Has BMW ""fallen"" a couple of notches in power/acceleration? I don't think so. Others have tried to make 0-60 the metric of comparison. BMW makes a 5 passenger M5 that matches my 911S in straight line acceleration and runs circles around anything out of Japan in handling.

Otherwise, we'd be driving elises, or we'd find some way to bring over an ariel atom.  For me, what's great about the BMW is the overall balance. The handling is superb, yet the ride is not very harsh. Power is good, but the engine is not thrashy and the car still achieves good fuel economy. The car is roomy inside(you may argue this) yet it maintains a efficient outside package. The reliability is good. The interior is quite good. The resale is strong.  IMO( again, just my opinion ) every other car in the category fails on at least one of these points, typically more, and for that reason, i wouldn't consider that car. The g35 gets bad fuel economy, the engine is thrashy, and it feels just a bit ponderous to me. The TL has nose-heavy FWD handling. The CTS has a pretty bad interior. The a4 is very nose heavy and the back seat is tight. All IMO and not reasons someone else shouldn't consider that car.  Think of it this way: Michael Jordan wasn't the best in the league at any one of his specific overall skills. But his overall package was tough to beat.  dave"

I wasn't comparing an M3 to anything, I was just noting it was part of the 3 series (to some underpowered 3 series) and BMW has all the hp you want, just in a different dollar strata than Lexus. In addition, there was some commentary on the apparent ""slowness"" of the M3. Some of the hp issues will most likely be a non-issue with the arrival of the 335.

Logically, if one is driving an expressway that was designed in such a fashion and the speed limit is 50 (isn't that just a road? - 50 mph is slower than most of the normal roadways upon which I grew up driving), then yes someone doing 80 is outlandish.  On the flipside, the I-15 corridor to Vegas is desolate for over 150 miles. It's nothing but dirt and road. Same with 350+ miles of I-5 between Valencia and SF/Sac.  Just 15 minutes ago I drove out of Kansas City to the airport. Two to three lane freeway. It's 4:30-5 am. Repeatedly I was forced to pass on the right because jerks in the left lane felt they didn't need to move to the right for faster moving traffic. I was only doing 80 for god's sake! - on freeways with speeds ranging from 65 to 70. These selfish drivers could clearly see me approach. They couldn't have missed my slowing, flashing of my high beams, waiting, flashing and eventual circumvention of their inconsiderate driving. Yes, inconsiderate. If one is in the ""fast"" lane, a car is approaching from behind and it's safe to move right, then one, as a considerate driver, should move to the right post haste. It's that simple. Courteous, concientious drivers do this. The vast majority of drivers in the USA do not operate their vehicles in that manner. They feel entitled to any lane they pick. They merge in the same manner - speed limit is 65 and they get on the freeway at 55...then complain everybody drives too fast.  Argh...  Can't wait to get home.

Dealers usually trade car at port right after they arrived. For my region the port the Jacksonville.  2. Request the car before they shipped out. This is not custom-build, instead the dealers request the car right after they rolled out of the assembly line. If dealers don't have special request then it's up to Lexus to distribute the cars.  3. Customer-build. This option takes the longest (usually up to 120 days) and yes you can customize your car.

2156,goodegg,June 2006,I find my TL seats far from soft  I second that. The TL's thigh bolsters are hard. Can't wait til they soften up after some use.
2157,aaargh,June 2006,"When I test drove both the TL (which I bought) and the BMW 330 in 2004, I remember the BMW seats to be way too hard for me, much harder than the TL's and that's saying something. The dash was too spartan for me as well.  I believe there are 'driving enhusiasts' who want seats that hard. For me though, a good (not great) performer with comfort is the best mix.  Those making generalizations like 'your opinion is in the minority' one way or the other lose credibility in my view. If you talk mostly to enthusiasts, the BMW seats are just right and you will feel those of us who like the mixture are in the minority. I see it the other way. I have no way of quantifying it and I think others have no way either.  As has already been said, it's what is best for each individual, not what anyone else thinks is best (even if they are in the minority )."
2158,louiswei,June 2006,"aargh, I couldn't say it better ."
2159,pearl,June 2006,"Well, pupap, the IS350 is a nice car, assuming you can fit inside one. When I test drove one, my head was touching the liner no matter how I adjusted the seat. The salesman suggested that I tilt it back - sorry. I am not tall (6'0) but have this problem in the GS as well. Judging by comments on this board and others, Toyota/Lexus seems to have much more of an issue here than most other brands. I have never had this problem in a BMW. It is good that you like your IS, and also good that (apparently) you fit."
2160,habitat1,July 2006,"European Delivery. 15% off MSRP = great lease rates.  European delivery is a great deal, but I don't think ED prices are anywhee near 15% off MSRP.

I was able to negotiate further discounts, but you could do that with a US delivery model as well."
2161,mikefm58,July 2006,Sounds like your dealer wasn't as aggressive with ED pricing. Most folks are posting pretty good pricing discounts using the ED method. There's some documents over at bimmerfest.com that show specific pricing details between US and European delivery.
2162,pat,July 2006,for this ongoing thread!!
2163,blueguydotcom,July 2006,"European delivery is a great deal, but I don't think ED prices are anywhee near 15% off MSRP.  Really, you should tell that to all of us who do it.  As I recall from considering a 5 series a couple of years ago, it was something like 8% off the base MSRP;  You're working off the silly ED MSRP on the BMW site. You negotiate from BMW's wholesale ED invoice price. On a 330i that's 30,975. Add 750-1500 for dealer profit (most get 1000 over) and 695 for shipping (you pay this on any bmw). BMW CCA rebate = $500 for a 3 series.  all options were at full MSRP.  again, not true. Depends on the dealer. I paid invoice price on options.  I was able to negotiate further discounts, but you could do that with a US delivery model as well.  If you can negotiate over 5k off MSRP when there are not incentives on the car, god bless.  A 530i's priced at 47.5k MSRP, ED invoice price should be around 41.5k with dealer profit. A 550 is 58.5k msrp and 51k with dealer profit."
2164,habitat1,July 2006,"If you can negotiate over 5k off MSRP when there are not incentives on the car, god bless  On a 550i 6-speed, I could have paid $1,500 over invoice, US or ED. The difference between those is 7-8%, not 15%. Why your dealer would discount the ED price, but not the US price, I don't know.  BMW's ED program is one of the best in the business. I am not disputing you on that. But the price difference of 15% would only be the case for a buyer that is savvy enough to negotiate a discount to ED, but so completely gullible as to pay US MSRP.  P.S. I negotiated a $10k discount on a 911 S Cab when they were still in high demand and most were being sold at or near full MSRP. So, I don't think there is a sigle BMW, short of the M5, that I couldn't get at $1,000 over US invoice with a little trying. And the M5 isn't available through ED."

Why your dealer would discount the ED price, but not the US price, I don't know.  They would discount regular price but not to ED levels. And that wouldn't help in the least with a lease.

2167,habitat1,July 2006,"The difference is 14% for a 550i.  You are either having severe math or comprehension problems. I said I was offered $1,500 over the respective US or ED invoice on a 550i by my dealer. He didn't care which way I went. The base prices, not including destination or options, would have been:  US = $54,000 + 1,500 = $55,500 ED = $50,045 + 1,500 = $51,555  That $3,945 difference is 7.11% of the base price. In actuality, it would have been less than 7% on a car ordered with a few thousand in options, since they are identically priced either way.  You don't need to use Voodoo economics to promote BMW ED. It is a good program that can save a savvy buyer another 7% +/-, not including travel expenses. On the lease side, you also have to consider that you will be paying for at least a month that your car is on a boat or the port."
2168,blueguydotcom,July 2006,"That $3,945 difference is 7.11% of the base price. In actuality, it would have been less than 7% on a car ordered with a few thousand in options, since they are identically priced either way.  I'm talking off MSRP. Why the blazes would I care if someone can get 1500 over US invoice on a car? That's a lousy deal. In the end that wouldn't help terribly much with a lease (some but not alot). I'm talking v. MSRP it's a 14-15% savings.  On the lease side, you also have to consider that you will be paying for at least a month that your car is on a boat or the port  You also get one month free from BMW. Add it up on a two year lease and it's a ridiculous savings. Yes, you pay a month without the car. I assume that month is covered by the BMWCCA rebate (and then some if it's a 5 series which gets a 1k rebate).  More than the monetary savings you get a chance to do things with your car that a minute fraction have ever experienced. How many people can say they've motored along on the road legally at over 140 mph? In their own car? The car that's now sitting in the garage? My god, I may find my 330i ZSP boring as all hell (which gives you a hint at my distaste for the rest of this segment) but I have the fondest memories of that car and roaring through the alps, cruising through monaco, blasting down the autostrada, gliding along the french coast and of course streaking across Germany.  For me, that will always be priceless. When I think about my stupid low lease on my car and how people are paying 550, 600, 650 for a 330i, it almost makes me like the car."
2169,spiritinthesky,July 2006,"I've bought three BMW's over the years using ED. Including my last one - a 2003 M5 in whcih I got no discount.  That said, habitat is accurate with the economics.

It came down to the BMW and Lexus. A comparable BMW would be over $35 if I could find one equiped how I wanted (need smaller engine for economy and Nav since I drive a lot). Assuming the same type of deal, the Lexus was about $3-4k less. The Lexus just seemed like the best choice for me."
2173,primetime79,July 2006,Bmw is definitely upping the ante. It will be interesting to see how the car manfactures that compete with BMW respond. BMW should be concerned that they price themselves out of their segment!  http://www.e90post.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=33280&d=1153751708

It seems likely that it will lease for a similar price, even if its sticker is somewhat more expensive.  I wonder if in '06 the lineup will change to 325i/330i/335i or if the 1-series will take up the bottom rung. It's important to not make the people who bought 330's just a year ago rue their purchase or to leave BMW with a mass of off-lease cars selling below their residuals.  BMW seems to be working very hard at maintaining their position as a top-tier premium manufacturer while still having an attainable entry-level car. It does seems like a difficult line to walk.

2188,blueguydotcom,August 2006,We know Nissan improved the interior - which is nice. And the 0-60 and power are great.

I can live with Nissan NVH (lived with it for years)...
2189,habitat1,August 2006,"You didn't owe it, but I appreciate the detailed response.  I have been a fan of BMW for many years, but I've yet to own one. Your disspointment with the E90 vs. E46 is interesting. Care to elaborate on the differences?  Several years ago, I was handed the keys to a 2001 M5. I thought I'd end up getting one when I could afford it. But, after seeing what i-drive did to the redesigned 5-series and hearing that the new M5 would only come with an SMG, I opted for keeping my TL and getting a 2005 911S Cabriolet last fall. In the 10 months since, I've put 3,200 miles on the TL and 8,600 miles on the 911. A very good decision.  I'm wondering if I will ever own a BMW, or just continue to admire them from afar. I considered the M3 when I was 911 shopping, but decided if I was getting a third car rather than replacing the TL, I wanted a sports car, not a coupe."

The ergonomics - window controls are placed wrong, center stack isn't canted toward the driver, dual HVAC 5. Slower 6. Long throws of the 6 speed 7. Higher ride height 8. Car is taller, thus higher seating position (closer to a G35 now, no longer sports car low seating position) 9. Less efficient engine 10. Muted steering 11. Extremely quiet ride 12. Utter lack of engine noise 13. Muted roadfeel 14. Feeling of isolation from road 15. Run flat tires  I've been looking at 99-2000 911s as a possible replacement for my 330i.

2192,louiswei,August 2006,"Nah, I really don't care if the G35 beats 335i or not. I am not a Nissan/Infiniti fan anyway. My prediction is if there aren't anything dramatic happening the 335i will continue to lead the field until the next generation of performance sedans come out (2010 maybe?).  However, I am interesting to see how this HP war is going to play out. There is got to have an end for this because if not, 5 years from now we'll be looking at bunch of performance sedans with close to 400 HP :surprise: with sticker price pushing $50K. I really hope Lexus, Infiniti and even Acura to concentrate on improving their handlings in order to compete with BMW instead of trying to make some insane engine. I believe that I am speaking for many people here that I think we are all looking for a well-balanced performance sedan instead of a drag strip muscle car."

2195,habitat1,August 2006,"Thanks for the e90 vs. e46 review.  I do think the e90 has been successful in the marketplace because many of the things that bother you (and would me) go right over the head of a lot of non-enthusiast drivers. Some of them are actually preferred - bigger, quieter, heavier.  But I hope BMW doesn't forget that enthusiasts gave BMW much of it's brand equity. If everyone was happy with 4,000 lb A4 Quatros and 300-hp Buick - I mean Lexus - IS350's, there wouldn't be much need for a BMW brand at all.  Some purists even feel Porsche went too far in taking the edge off the beloved 993 model 911 when they introduced the 996. Fortunately the 997, while being a good daily driver, puts back some of that precision and feel.  Good luck in your hunt for a 911. I don't think Porsche and BMW are mutually exclusive in our house, but it would be tough to justify replacing a sedan (TL) that I'm only driving 25% of the time now."
2196,graphicguy,August 2006,"But, some of the reasons some of you didn't buy a BMW e-90 are the same reasons I did......  --bigger --more refined --perferred the new interior over the old --quieter (at least until you get up in the rev range where it's every bit as smooth....maybe smoother)  That's not to say I didn't like the e-46. I just liked the e-90 better."
2197,louiswei,August 2006,"Hmm...for me I like the e46 better than E90. Reasons:  1. Better exterior style (BMW, please sent Bangle packing, pleasessssssss) 2. Driver oriented interior design.  I would definitely consider a 3 as my next car if BMW doesn't use the Bangle design anymore and implementing a more refined interior like the E46's."
2198,dhanley,August 2006,"It's amazing how varied taste is.  I picked an e36 over the e46 because of how much i disliked the e46 exterior. I thought it looked bland, like a bar of soap, and very feminine.  I was sort of ""meh"" on the e90's appearance for awhile, but i quite like the looks of it now.  I am also pleased with the new refinement and slightly bigger size. The interior is also a step up, i think, except that is is less driver focused.  I'm not at all a fan of the runflats, and i didn't like HP/torue bias of the non-turbo 3.0L. The 3.0T fixes the torque issue in a big way, however.  dave"

2540,cdnpinhead,November 2006,Thanks for the comprehensive review. Helpful stuff.
2541,nyccarguy,November 2006,"BRAVO  Very nice, well thought out review. Keep us posted. Driving the cars is SO much different than comparing them on paper."
2542,cbanct,November 2006,"Excellent review !  I am sure many Edmunds fans will appreciate your thoughtful input. My assesment after driving both cars is similar. Most peolple would be happy in either car. However, the distinguishing part is what I call the wow or smile factor.  If you love to drive, then the 335i is the car. It makes me feel like a better driver, because it handles so well. I find myself smiling when driving the 335i. The pull when hitting the gas is exhilarating. The exhaust note on the 335i is music!  The electronics in the 335i is nowhere close to the G35. If I decide to get the 335i I would have to get an after market navigation like the Pioneer systems. I wonder where the best place is to have this installed ?  There are some concerns with the 335i, such as the run flat tires.  I did not compare stereos. Has anyone done that ?  cbanct"
2543,allargon,November 2006,I agree with all the above except the resale part. I've noticed the 3 series resale values taking exceptionally hard 1st year hits lately with all these redesigns and renumberings. I know you based it on the residuals. I'm curious what the numbers will actually be in a year or so.
2544,jimmy81,November 2006,I did not compare stereos  Who cares? I'd rather listen to the car.
2545,habitat1,November 2006,Nice review.  I wish Warren Brown (automotive editor of the Washington Post) would give up his job to someone like you. Would make for far more relevent and interesting reading than hearing about how he can't fit his sorry fat butt in a sport seat.
2546,dynamos,November 2006,"My 2 cents. I purchased a 07 G35 with Premium and auto. It was $11K less than a comparably equipped 335i. While BMW does give you free maintenance, they only change the oil every 15K miles, which turns out to be only about 3 service visits over 48K miles. Even with the synthetic oil I was never comfortable with the long service interval. Also, having owned both BMW and Infiniti, I will take the reliability of Infiniti over Bimmer any day. Further, Infiniti provides a 70K powertrain warranty compared to only 50K at BMW. Also, my experience is dealer service is much better from Infiniti--who provide a loan car for any service. Getting a service loaner at BMW is always a hassle."
2547,stl540,November 2006,"Congrats on the new G.  The three recommended visits over 45K miles for the 335i is a wonderful thing. Time is precious and spending unnecessary time at a dealer is not appealing to me.  I was also hesistant on the l5K service interval. I posted the lab results of an oil change of my 540i a couple years ago. Here is the link: stl540, ""BMW 5-Series Sedans"" #8770, 18 Apr 2004 5:03 pm!keywords=allin%3Amsgtext%20limit%3ABMW%3A5%2520Series%20stl540%20oil%20change. The results exceeded my expectations and would lead one to believe that the engineers actually know what they are talking about. I am surprised that Infiniti still recommends 3700 oil changes when many (if not most) manufacturers recommend 7K+ service intervals. Some car companies have been recommending a 15K mile interval over 7 years with success.  Neither Infiniti nor BMW are known to be as reliable as Honda or Toyota. They both have their share of issues as they both push the envelope on technology much more than Hon or Toy. I have examples (some personal) on good and bad experiences of Infiniti and BMW. I had some major mechanical issues with my 540i outside of warranty. Fortunately my dealer was able to get them covered for me. A friend of mine who owns a 2003 G35 had his car in the shop quite a bit. I also have friends with BMW's and Infiniti's with higher mileage with minimal issues.  My BMW dealer has been wonderful. I have a BMW loaner for any service visit. It definitely makes the experience much better. Glad to hear your Infiniti dealer treats you right.  Happy driving. Enjoy the car."
2548,stl540,November 2006,"All - Thanks for the comments. I am glad you enjoyed. I really enjoyed driving the machines!!  I have followed the forums on Edmunds to read other perspectives on cars, etc for 6 years. I would like to share more, but find it hard to get the time to do so. Cars are my passion and I love to drive."
2549,dynamos,November 2006,"stl540: Thanks for the thoughful reply. As far as Honda reliability, Honda/Acura(Accord/TL) has experienced major automatic transmission issues over the last few years, but have been able to keep the news quiet. I had a Honda person comment to me(tongue-in-cheek) that they were having workers comp issues because of all of the mechanics back injuries caused from lifting the transmissions. Also, Toyota (Camry) has had ""sludge"" issues, but has also kept that out-of-the press. I owned a 740i which caused me to get to know the BMW service personnel way too well."
2550,stl540,November 2006,"I experienced a tranny failure in our 2002 Acura MDX at 78K miles. I was quoted $3500 to replace. The dealer stated the never see tranny failures of the beloved Acura brand. I took the car with me and did research (needless to say, I was not happy). It was not hard to find many others who experienced tranny failures on Honda/Acura for MY 2000-2002 around 60K to 80K by doing a quick Google search.  After becoming more educated, I pushed back on the dealer and they got Honda to pay for parts and I paid for labor ($800). I was happy with the outcome, but not happy with the 'we never see this happen' remark. I personally know at least 4 other people who experienced tranny failures around 60K-80K on Honda/Acura.  We purchased another Honda for my wife...a 2006 'mom mobile' (hope she does not read this comment ). Besides the tranny failure, the Acura was rock solid until we sold it at 90K miles. I expect the Odyssey to do the same, w/o the tranny issue (fingers crossed)."
2551,nyccarguy,November 2006,"Congrats on the purchase of your new G35. Enjoy it. I've yet to see a new one on the road, but I like what I see in the pictures.  There has been lots of debate for BMWs long service intervals. I know the reccomended service intervals have been lengthened since BMW started paying. That being said, BMW engineers are very smart people and I'm sure ther 15,000 mile estimate is somewhat on the conservative side (Porsche has 2 year/20,000 mile oil change intervals). My Dad currently has an '04 X5 3.0iA with 58,000 miles. His first oil change was not until 18,000 miles. Before his X5, he had a QX4 which was a nice truck. The convenience of longer oil change intervals is really nice for him.  Just to clarify, BMW free maintenance doesn't just cover oil changes. It covers brake pads & rotors, brake fluid, windshield wipers, Xenon headlights just to name a few things."
2552,kdshapiro,November 2006,"""Just to clarify, BMW free maintenance doesn't just cover oil changes. It covers brake pads & rotors, brake fluid, windshield wipers, Xenon headlights just to name a few things.""  I think you mean, it doesn't cover oil changes inbetween the recommended service interval. All new BMWs come with full maintenance which includes all b-b wear and tear items."
2553,nyccarguy,November 2006,"No, I meant to say that you get more than just 3 oil changes (as was stated in a post above) within the 4 year/50K free maintenance."
2554,autoedu,November 2006,"In this segment of Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans there are many great cars but Saab 9-3 and Volvo S40 are clearly distinguishing themselves from the rest with style, class, safety, and the marriage between sophistication and simplicity - the essence of Scandanavian design.  Traditionally people with money who want to be different buys saab and volvo, now it's a fashion to own this breed of euro cars."
2555,autoedu,November 2006,"http://www.saabroup.com http://www.volvo.com  Not too many people realized how big the Saab & Volvo corportion is...from submarine to jet, truck to tanker, weapons to satellite. The Saab & Volvo Group makes everything with goverment support. There were cross-research and development when saab & volvo cars division exist under the big group - a big reason why old Volvo and Saab cars are so strong and reliable.  GM is trying to resurrect Saab as a luxury and high-performance brand with ""Saab born from Jets...founded by 16 engineers"" campaign.  Volvo is attracting more buyers through better design. It took Volvo a decade; the once boxy and boring Volvos are now the most fashionable, beautiful and still safest car.  BMW is the best handling performance vehicle in this segment but it's a dime a dozen on the street, becoming like the camrys and accords.  Mercedes sells on its undeniable strong brand and recognition although its reliability has deminished in recent production.  Lexus, Infinity, Acura are relatively young brands with attractive products that attract younger crowd.  Audi is going after BMW with performance and a blend of style. Audi is attracting BMW alternative buyer.  Cadillac is becoming the standard of American luxury. Mature yet spirited"
2556,habitat1,November 2006,"""Not too many people realized how big the Saab & Volvo corportion is...from submarine to jet, truck to tanker, weapons to satellite. The Saab & Volvo Group makes everything with goverment support. There were cross-research and development.."" A friend of mine is the General Counsel of Saab Aerospace NA. The car company and the aerospace company have NOTHING to do with each other since the sale to GM (and not a whole lot before). He can't even get an courtesy employee discount to buy a 9-5, so he drives something else.  The ""born of jets"" is a nice marketing pitch. That's about it, relative to where the company has been for the last decade.  ""Audi is going after BMW with performance and a blend of style. Audi is attracting BMW alternative buyer.""  If Audi is going after BMW in performance, they aren't doing a very good job. I get Audi's as loaners when I take my Porsche in for service. The A4/A6 AWD's are exceptionally heavy cars and feel sluggish off the line. They don't offer the nimbleness and performance of my Acura TL 6-speed, let alone a RWD 330i or 5-series. And, if I'm not mistaken, the A6 cannot even be ordered with a manual transmission. I test drove the S4 and M3 before electing to get a 911 and the M3 was three times the driver's car that the S4 was.  BMW's may be more plentiful on the roads, but I consider that a testiment to thier success in delivering substance. You can be much more ""unique"" driving an Acura RL or A6, but you won't be within a mile of the driving experience of the 550i 6-speed I tested recently. And those aren't exactly a dime a dozen."
2557,merc1,November 2006,"Lexus, Infinity, Acura are relatively young brands with attractive products that attract younger crowd.  Not Lexus. Beyond the IS250/350 Lexus isn't attracting any young folk with the ES,RX,SC and LS. Lexus isn't even close to Infiniti's demographic.  Cadillac is becoming the standard of American luxury.  Kinda by default since Chrysler never hasn't been a real luxury brand since forever and Ford has pretty much ruined Lincoln. Cadillac's lead over them isn't even funny, but compared to the import luxury big 3 (Lexus/BMW/MB) Cadillac ain't standing on much.  I won't even get into the ridiculously disgusting things GM has done to Saab. I used to like Saabs, but no more. Well except for the 9-3 Convertible. The 9-5 looks like an aged Hollywood actress with an obvious facelift.  M"
2558,kdshapiro,November 2006,"""BMW is the best handling performance vehicle in this segment but it's a dime a dozen on the street, becoming like the camrys and accords.""  Maybe because there is something behind the name. Volvo S40 in the same league as a BMW. That is preposterous."
2559,circlew,November 2006,"""BMW is the best handling performance vehicle in this segment but it's a dime a dozen on the street, becoming like the camrys and accords.""  January 2006 Sales Camry - 27,000 Accord - 22,000 3 Series - 2,000  I wish there was some truth to the flip statements...let's get real. That is why it costs more and sells less. You get what you pay for. It's basic transportation vs. a real road trip."
2560,allargon,November 2006,"According to Consumer Reports, the Saab 9-5 is more reliable than the e46 BMW's. However, the e90 3 series has way fewer black dots. The 335 is too new for anyone to draw any conclusions.  However, the 9-5 isn't considered the entry level vehicle. The Epsilon based 9-3 is. It's not considered reliable at all by CR even though its platform cousins, the Pontiac G6 and the Chevrolet Malibu Maxx are."
2561,dhamilton,November 2006,"The Saab, or any Saab for that matter, just can't match the buttoned down feel of the Audi or BMW IMO. Their are just to many cheap plasticy parts, and, well, it just isn't glued down like German car"
2562,laurasdada,November 2006,"Hello, Edward:  I agree with most of your comments on G35 vs. TL. In fact, for those reasons (and a few more) the TL was the car for me. Gotta disagree with your comments (and neither of us is wrong, of course) in that I find the TL to be a very handsome, aggressive and somewhat understated design from almost any angle. The G, while not unnattracive (like the overdone, overwrought, overbaked CTS!) to me appears just a bit too tall and narrow on the exterior with a rear view only a mother could love. I'd give the TL a 9, the G a 7.  Viva la difference!"
2563,ggesq,November 2006,"plekto,  There is no more 330i post MY 2006. It's now called the 335i. (with 300 hp) I don't know what you mean about the 3 only being good in the M trim. IMHO, until the M3 gets redesigned the 335i is an awesome value compared to the M3. Insofar as maintenance is concerned BMW offers a 4yr- 50k mile maintenance free plan.  Acura has made a serious attempt in providing luxury with its TL. How didn't it feel ""luxury"" to you? If you mean by the ride- then sure- it's got a stiff ride, but so does most of the cars in this class. For the most part, people admire the ""luxury"" in the TL.  MB has some serious QC issues with its vehicles these days.  Volvo S60 - the best luxury for the money? A completely stripped 208hp S60 MSRP's at $31,580 including destination. Add in some ""luxury"" and your well on your way in being out of your price range.  RX-8? Isn't this a 2-door?"
2564,kdshapiro,November 2006,"""RX-8? Isn't this a 2-door?""  And a smallish one at that. I think there are two more seats, but I wouldn't want to sit back there."
2565,blueguydotcom,November 2006,"The rear doors are suicide doors but it's a 4 door nonetheless. Cost-wise it's the cheapest of the bunch. If you just want a car like that - fast, decent handling - get a Scooby Legacy 2.5 or Mazdaspeed6. They're compact/midsize sedans, well under 30k and fast, good handling."
2566,edwardsf,November 2006,"I think they are both great looking cars. And yes, the TL is more understated. I am thinking of three cars myself: TL, A4 2.0T, and a Suburu Legacy GT wagon. Note that the G is not there. I don't like its interior and find it cramped (I am 6-3). I think the Legacy is the most nimble and fun to drive of the three but don't like its gas mileage. The A4, TL and 328 are really quite remarkable in that they are performance sedans with 30+ mpg on the highway. The TL is an amazing package in that it also has very user friendly tech AND reliablity."
2567,blueguydotcom,November 2006,"Stopped by a dealer and drove the G35S today. Hmmm. Interior materials are big step up. The car feels more solid, refined and really planted (if not heavy). some thoughts:  Slight hesitation on acceleration. Engine is really quiet. No real NVH from the redesigned 3.5 and chassis. At speed the 5 speed auto is okay but the car feels incorrectly geared. Auto paddle response was okay but still too slow for my tastes. They didn't have a 6 speed manual on the lot. Acceleration was decent but not mindblowing. The car felt a bit more muscular than my weak-kneed 2006 330i. Steering felt heavy at all speeds - okay but a tad too muted during spirited moves. Interior was quite cramped - what happened to the wide-open interior of the last gen? This is more cockpit-like but in an overly snug way. I'm five-seven and 145 lbs and the G35 felt way too tight. Seats blow majorly. They're soft, poorly bolstered (even with controls used to tighten bolsters), feel flimsy and are not comfortable for even short drives. LCD display is worthless during the day. At full brightness it was still hard to read (20/20 vision). Soft ride and compliant on all road surfaces but tons of road roar.  Overall - I liked the look the exterior. Better interior materials. More upscale. But the car has lost its edgier character, feeling more sedate, buttoned-down and even more muted and removed than the e90.  If I could change my list from the other day the G35S with automatic would be on the side of ""wouldn't consider.""  Could a manual change the character that much? Maybe. I will have to try the manual version eventually but it's hard to believe that the tranny could make a car feel so wrong. Then again, an automatic e90/e46 3 series feels like absolute, unresponsive garbage to me too.  BTW, while at my BMW dealer last night I looked over the 3 series coupe with my girlfriend. We agreed, it's one boring, lame looking car. I didn't want to drive the 335i as they didn't have a manual on the lot and I would probably want to trade my woefully underpowered 330i for it immediately.  Right now if price were an issue - 30k or under:  GTI A3 328  Under 40k: 335"
2568,cdnpinhead,November 2006,"Useful information. Thanks.  The 328 is my top contender, followed by the G35 coupe (assuming my bicycle will fit through that triangular opening).  Your input helps move the G35 farther down the list. OTOH, the C230 or CTS 3.6 aren't anyone's favourite these days either. They do have RWD though, unlike the A3."
2569,blueguydotcom,November 2006,I'm still a little dumbstruck. I fully expected the new G35 to be much better.
2570,cdnpinhead,November 2006,"Maybe you really do get what you pay for.  I drove a loaded Maxima rental during a collision repair last year. It was fine, but not what I would consider luxury (interior), let alone performance (handling). I've not driven a G yet, but extrapolating the Maxima doesn't get me very excited.  Most don't care. Some of us do. That's why I was pleased to get your impressions of the revised G."
2571,jimmy81,November 2006,I'm five-seven and 145 lbs and the G35 felt way too tight.  I'm a bit 'heftier' than you (6' 207). I didn't even test drive the new G since it was too tight. Couldn't envision the claustrophobia going on on a long trip. But to hear a 'smaller' guy (?) has trouble getting comfortable in that cockpit makes me wonder about the size of the engineers designing the car in the first place. Smaller Japanese homeys?  Actually the 3 series is the same way with me - kinda tight. The TL is the clear choice for not banging your knees into the door and center stack constantly.
2572,plekto,November 2006,"First off, my prices that I quoted were all from carsdirect.com and are as such, verifiable.  Secondly, It's called REBATES AND INCVENTIVES. That's how a 9-5 and a S60 can get down to such silly prices.  Thirdly, Manual transmission is a must. Almost every one of these cars go from a rocket to your uncle's highway float-o-mobile(sm) when they are hampered with the automatic. Nowhere is it more evident, though, than in the Cadillac CTS. If you can't learn stickshift, just get a used midsize luxo-barge and be happy, because nothing under $30K(with an automatic) exists that I'd consider ""luxury"" and ""performance"".  Fourth, Those ultra-small cars almost all universally fail the ""luxury"" definition as they are cramped inside. There's nothing ""luxury"" to me if I feel like a sardine while I'm in it. Compare a S40 to a S60. Who cares wwhat Volvo calls it, it's not a luxury car. Neither is the A4 or most of the rest. Sure, they're MADE by luxury brands, but as their entry-level offering, it's not enough to have the name on it. Even stuffing a bigger 6 cylinder engine won't most of the time as well.  My ideal for luxury is an old mid 90's S-class. While none of these come close to that level, to be sure, I feel that they should still exhibit some of the qualities in part to be considered ""luxury"".  And claustrophobic is the anthesis of luxury in my book. What ever happened to having a nice upright well-laid out interior? I'd much rather drive an old 80's BMW than most of these things. I'm 5'7"" and about 160lbd. Pretty ""normal"", and when I turn the wheel hard(hand over hand technique)and my left elbow hits the window, it's just not right.  Oh - while we're on the S60, I said a bare-bones T5 model with the bigger engine. Under 30K and worth every penny. Why NOT get ""not entry level"" for the same price?  A few comments about some of the cars:  The reality is that the A4 is a maintainence nightmare. When I said they have to pull the engine halfway out to service it, I wasn't joking. That adds up to very pricey BMW-like maintainence. The Cadillac Catera also had this exact same problem. Oh - and a minor point - can someone please smack Audi upside their heads' over the joke of a cupholder?  The BMW is a pathetic little thing like ths IS250 is. Not enough power and not even close to the M3(or even the upper-end) model that made the entire line famous. And at under 30K, it's bare-bone at that. To me, it screams ""Mercedes 190"" to me.  The RX-8 - no bling - not luxury at all, but it is a sedan(I count 4 doors with their own hinges). I thought I'd add this since it represents the most RWD acceleration and handling that $25K(after rebates and incentves of course) can buy you.  The G35 - Yes, you too noticed how the old models are better - the new one is like they are trying to copy a 350Z. Sigh. But the older generation with the manual gearbox is a joy to drive.  The CTS with the 3.6VVT engine and stickshift is an astounding machine. A bit ugly(okay, a LOT UGLY), but with 6 speeds and 255HP, plus almost all of its torque available at 1600-2000rpm, it'll suck you back into your seat like nothing else will for the price. Driving it, it reminded me of a softer-sprung upper-end 3 series or a new IS300. Sure, it has less HP, but it hits maximum torque at half the rpms as well, so it pulls hard like a turbo-diesel.  All in all, none of them really fit the criteria perfectly. Though, the S60 is probably the closest. But it's not really a ""fair"" comparison, either, as it's not entry-level. Gotta love rebates"
2573,kdshapiro,November 2006,"None of these cars are luxury cars. The segment is entry level luxury sport sedans. Manufacturers who make luxury automobiles, these are the bottom of the heap. Last I looked Volvo or Mazda don't make luxury vehicles.  Rebates and incentives will be gone in a few months for 2006 models. It's a pricing anomaly, much like Black Friday. Comparing a 2006 Volvo outgoing model with a new 2007 335i is ludicrous. The 335i is king of the entry level sport sedan. Fastest, most planted, best looking. To expensive? A Camry or Accord is the ticket. I would rather pay $43K for a 335 than whatever for an S60. So would a lot of people I gather.  Of course, the 335i may not be right for you for a variety of reasons, none of which has to do with it's performance, unless you're afraid of it's 4.7 seconds to 60.  One more thing - the TMV price according to Edmunds is on par for the S60 vs 335i. Comparing the consumer ratings however, one is 9.5 the other is 7.7. Can you guess which rating belongs to which car?  I tried to do my car internet purchase. I tried carsdirect.com, I ended up by not using them. I don't consider them to be the authority on pricing."
2574,plekto,November 2006,"Yet their prices are legitimate enough. Actually, you can haggle quite a better deal on many of the cars if you want - I just use them as an example of ""average"" pricing for those who don't want to haggle or drive around.  Of course the BMW is going to be more favorable, but you can't get(still new) 2006 BMW for $26,400. The S60 T5, which isn't even their lowest end model is the same price as a Camry V6. I don't see Mercedes or BMW or Lexus offering those sorts of deals.  And it's NOT ""black Friday"" - it's a fact of life for GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mistubishi, Mazda, and many others. For 3-4 months out of the year, you can get silly low prices on their leftover stock. That's not one weekend. It's roughly a third of the entire year, and when most sane people buy their new cars.(leases are totally seperate).  As for the S60, it's certainly more luxurious than the others. The original poster wanted a luxury sedan that was sporty and luxurious for under 30K. This was different than the topic of this group, but we replied anyways. It's a higher sert of criteria that he was looking for. And I suspect that the S60 will be a better solution than an A4, as he seemed to want something a bit larger than a crackerbox if he could manage it."
2575,kdshapiro,November 2006,"""The S60 T5, which isn't even their lowest end model is the same price as a Camry V6""  Got what you're saying, but would still buy the Camry over the Volvo in a heartbeat.  ""I don't see Mercedes or BMW or Lexus offering those sorts of deals.""  You never will.  ""original poster wanted a luxury sedan that was sporty and luxurious for under 30K.""  The Volvo isn't a luxury sedan, like the Accord V6 fully decked out isn't a luxury sedan. If the op was talking 2007 models only it's a totally different picture."
2576,edwardsf,November 2006,"Since you are a short guy, let me add a little bit of normal to large guy perspective. I am 6-2, with a long torso, meaning that most cars have poor headroom or vision for me. The S60 has has a raked roof and I can't see well out of it. The Lexus, 3 series, and the G35 all have similar headroom or vision problems. The A4, C230 and TL all have more headroom and better vision for me.  I have driven an S60 - extensively - from SF to Tahoe and back under all conditions. It is a good car. It has nice seats and even a usable back seat. But it does not perform like the A4 2.0T or the 3 series or the G or .... It does not handle as well as any of those cars and it is not nearly as nimble and it does not have as much midrange usuable torque passing someone going up Highway 50 at 5000 ft as even my 97 Saab 900SE.  But you can go on about E series and 7 series in the ENTRY performance level thread. And you can go on about poor reliability of A4s (directly contradicted by Consumer Repots) and something you made up about engines bays (the S4 has a 4.2 in it so your claims are really bogus). But the reality is that you probably don't really care about helping out a buyer or fairly discussing ENTRY level luxury perfomance cars. You seem to simply want crow about how great your S60 is. Again, all the cars discussed in this car are good cars. Maybe if you tried driving more than one of them, you might see the light. That is, if you can see over the dash."

You're not going to press a 3 or G hard, then hop in a Volvo S anything and feel like it's comparable. Ditto a FWD Lincoln MKZ or saab. Sorry, it's just not happening. This is about enty Level Luxury Performance sedans. The Volvo, Lincoln and Saab lineup are in the company of the Lexus ES world, not the performance sedan world."
2582,qbrozen,November 2006,have you ever driven an S60R?
2583,rockylee,November 2006,"Well I have seen several photo's of both the LS and Audi A8, and have in fact read several tests and reviews on all of them. The LS, and A8, have a few features not found on the Volvo S80. However Volvo, has a few safety gadgets not found on either the LS or A8. The S80 also costs $30K less and has a way better interior than both the LS and A8. It just might be the best ever in my eyes. The engine advantage goes to Audi and Lexus. The exterior styling goes to Volvo also. The Lexus, as fintail would say is numb. The Audi A8, and Volvo S80's driving dynamics are a toss-up. The A8 has a more firm ride and the Volvo, has the 4-C's suspension which gives it a wide range. I guess we could call that a toss up ? So the question is this is the A8 and Lexus LS really worth $30K more than the Volvo S60. For me, no-way-Jose ! I guess for some the extra $30+K buys you status. However the Volvo, wins IMHO on style points and its benchmark safety.  Rocky"
2584,kdshapiro,November 2006,"You might want to preface most of your post IMO. I've been in an S80 and I don't think it has anywhere near the interior of the A8 much less the outgoing LS.  As far as whether or not these cars are worth $30K more, the sales figures speak for themselves. People who buy these cars, don't blink twice about the price and Lexus, Audi and BMW sell cars at this price, because 1. there is a market, and 2. they can.  And I don't give a win to the ugly S80 on either style or safety. Volvo has been surpassed in recent years by every other manufacturer.  If you can't understand why people would want to pay the difference in price between the S80 and LS460, you might as well set your sights on an Elantra."
2585,louiswei,November 2006,"The S80 also costs $30K less and has a way better interior than both the LS and  Do you mean the interior MATERIAL QUALITY or STYLE? If you meant the style then I'll say the beauty is in the eyes of the beholders. If you meant the quality then I'll say you'll probably have to double check your vision. By the way, pictures usually don't tell much about interior material quality. For example, most GM and Ford cars' interior looks pretty decent in picture but once sitting in the cabin then it's a POS.  The exterior styling goes to Volvo also  Again, it's in your opinion. In my opinion, the Accord coupe looks way better than the MB E-class but does it mean that the Accord is better than the E? I think you know the answer.  The Lexus, as fintail would say is numb  First of all, the LS is designed to be a boat on land. To be fair, you should compare the S80 with the GS. I could guarantee you that the GS is not not be any ""number"" than the S80.  The Audi A8, and Volvo S80's driving dynamics are a toss-up. The A8 has a more firm ride and the Volvo, has the 4-C's suspension which gives it a wide range  What do you based this statement on? Your personal experience or mag reviews? Have you driven both the A8 and S80 (or the new LS) before? If not, have you seen any comparo that features the S80, A8 and the LS?  The bottom line is that the S80 is NOT in the same class as the A8 and LS size-wise, feature-wise and luxuriously-wise."
2586,louiswei,November 2006,"People who buy these cars, don't blink twice about the price and Lexus  True. I think people whom buy those cars care more about the donuts, leather sofa and 50"" plasma TVs in the waiting room more than the $30K difference between their car and a Volvo."
2587,rockylee,November 2006,"kd, WHATEVER dude !!! The Volvo S80's interior is light years ahead in the styling department over the LS and audi A8. Audi's latest interiors actually look like they should be in a Elantra. Lexus, has always had nice interiors but they are the same old, same old look. Very conservative. Whoever designed the S80's interior should get the nobel prize for automotive art. :P  Rocky  P.S. The A8 and LS460 compared to the 07' S80 is like taking a extra $30K and flushing it straight down the toilet IMHO. I'm just glad your not spending my money."

For example, most GM and Ford cars' interior looks pretty decent in picture but once sitting in the cabin then it's a POS.  Based on car mag and internet site reviews. My co-workers own Lexuses and I owned a Acura, at one time and I couldn't tell much of a difference in quality. They are basically the same grade as each other and I know this because I use to make the interior parts for all of them at JCI in Holland Mi.  Again, it's in your opinion. In my opinion, the Accord coupe looks way better than the MB E-class but does it mean that the Accord is better than the E? I think you know the answer.  Well the Accord is much more reliable and the quality difference really isn't that significant and yes I recently have sat in co-workers new Accord and a friends MB C-class.  What do you based this statement on? Your personal experience or mag reviews?  I gather my information from either my personal test or other sources like co-workers, friends, family, car mags, internet sites like edmunds where I can read actual owners opinions. I just don't come up with pie in the sky opinions even though sometimes it seems that way. If I had a billion dollars I'd still buy and prefer the S80, over the LS or A8. I don't have to wear a designers name on my butt for self-confidence and that's all you are doing with the LS or A8 IMHO.  The bottom line is that the S80 is NOT in the same class as the A8 and LS size-wise, feature-wise and luxuriously-wise.  Agree the Volvo S80, beats both of them hands down style- wise, feature-wise I give a slight edge to the LS 460. The Audi A8, is still 5 years behind in gadgetology. luxuriously-wise, well that depends on what you want ? If you want conservative 'more of the same' buy the Lexus. If you like BMW's latest designs you will also like the Audi A8 also. If you want something modern looking that is pleasing to the eye you will pocket the $30+K and drive a Volvo S80.  It's as easy as that isn't it ? :blush:  Buy a S80, and go on a road trip with the extra dough.  Rocky"

Did you test the sound system? Very nice. I'd so buy a S60R over a LaCrosse.  We agree on the BMW and Mercedes - heh. It's amazing what they charge these days for that plastic symbol on the hood, isn't it? When I can get somethig like the Lincoln that is nicer, larger, and less money than a *C Class*(let alone Mercedes' main lines) and cars like the Lucerne CXS start to approach the BMWs in quality...  No, not as good, but darn if you don't get a lot for your dollar. Mazda, btw, is my top pick for value for your money lately. The 6 is a very good car and a reason why you shouldn't buy a Hyundai. The 3 is so close to the new Civic in features and specs that it's scary, and the RX-8 is a bottle of youth with 4 seats. Just open it up and watch your worries evaporate  I still suggest you go test-drive a RX-8 for fun. You'll not regret it.  P.S. The reason Accura and Lexus look so simmilar is... They are Honda and Toyota in Japan. Those ""brands"" are foisted off on us in the U.S. for higher prices - while in Japan, it's just another Toyota or Honda.  And those two in Japan are like comparing Ford vs Chevy trucks. 6 of one, half dozen... :P"
2597,flash11,November 2006,"Ok, in basic terms please describe the criteria for entry level Luxury Performance Sedan that fits into being acceptable for this forum. I believe that there should not be a minimum price range, I don't think one was set. If you can find such a car under $30K built and performs better than these cars it should be mentioned. I drove the BMW 328xi, and the MB C230, are they considered in this class of car ? If they are then for sure the Lincoln MKZ surpasses them in quality, performance, luxury, standard options, price, and long term maintenance costs and deserves to be mentioned here. It is a midsized four seater sedan with 263hp. Overall it is a better car. As a matter of fact I believe that it is underrated and should be seriously taken into consideration here. I encountered this attitude with the salesman at MB, who does not consider any North American product in MB's class, seems narrow minded especially in the face of the facts. The Lincoln MKX is a great car for $29K, and oh, it comes in AWD at $31K since that seems to be a factor here, FWD=bad, cheap, low quality ?? Not sure why, I think Lincoln has outdone itself, good Job !  What dissappointed me was the Cadillac CTS, I did not like the angular exterior design. Also I was not impressed with the Acura TL-S, for the money I would rather get the Lincoln MKX at $35K you can fill it nicely with options, and the salesman was willing to deal from that MSRP ie. bargain for a 6 year extended warantee etc."

Luxury, on the other hand, has a large degree of subjectivity, so I can't agree with you there.  Now, back to the 335, if I was spending $40k and could live with its size, then great. The 335 seems like a GREAT car, and I'd love to get one. However, if I wanted to spend less, wanted AWD, and an adjustable suspension, with incredibly comfortable seats, I'd pick the S60R. So I'm still not sure why so many folks here are adverse to this car.  As I asked another poster who never replied ... have you driven an S60R?  I'm not saying its the best here. I'm not saying you should pick it over the precious bmw. All I'm saying is that it has its own merits and certainly deserves to sit in the forum alongside the others in this category."

Anything over 200HP with a manual transmission and a semi-luxury interior - with traction control and decent enough suspension to beat a Camry - that's what we're talking about. Something that you can pay a little more than a Camry V6 and get a much better overall package.  Entry-level luxury - check. Sporty feel to it - the manual gearbox(which is a very good gearbox as well - not typical entry-level junk) and the sport package make it work as well as any Mercedes C class or Audi 6 series. No, it's not a BMW 3 series, but it's also, oh - about $10K less.  And, yes, I know the Camry is fast in a straight line - but that's about it. It feels mushy and vague in turns and is a whale in traffic due to developing that HP at RPMs that are incompatable with the the transmission(except for a full-throttle magazine test/drag race)"
2632,rockylee,November 2006,Well the big 3 might be going through some difficult times right now. Some of which they can control and many others they can't. I won't kick a dead horse on it since it's been discussed several times in the past. I know some of you are huge european car fans and I respect that.

2637,rockylee,November 2006,I'll let you ask the experts....  Rocky
2638,plekto,November 2006,"http://www.carsdirect.com/build/options?zipcode=91020&acode=USB60VOC172B0&restor- e=false $32K for the AWD S60R(300HP)(~5.7 seconds 0-60)  http://www.carsdirect.com/build/options?zipcode=91020&acode=USB60VOC171B0&restor- e=false $26,400 for the T5 FWD model. (257HP Turbo-5) If the Turbo-5 sounds familiar, it's virtually the same engine they used in the 850 T5-R. It's no slouch 0-60. (about 6.5 seconds)  The base model is 24,500, but you need to add su much stuff to it that you might as well pay $500 more for the bigger engine. Pass.  The AWD 300HP model, though - that's an IS350 competitor most definately - just with more interior space(rear seat especially). $32K seems like a lot of car for the money.  Other plusses of the Volvos are storage and ergomics are top-notch, part of why it feels ""luxury"" is that a person sat and obesessed over it like the Swedes are famous for. You reach for something - it's right where it should be. I'm convinced Ford bought Volvo mostly for its interior and ergomics designers. The layout is understated Scandinavian design at its best - it's there, but it's as intruseive as the Avalon is(very good interior, btw - someone's been copying Volvo and Mercedes there - heh)  The sound system is astounding - forget aftermarket. And of course, the gearing is typical Volvo - all about performance and quickness and not about economy(thogh it does get 20/28). You hit maximum power exactly when you think you should and it's a joy in daily driving. Manual, of course. Automatic is a whole other thing, verging on a disaster. Given that 80-90% of cars in Europe are manuals, and the automatic is an afterthought design-wise for rental fleets of tourists from America, it's understandable why there's such a drastic difference between the two. BMW's simmilar in this respect - they really don't design the cars to work well with automatics either."
2639,blueguydotcom,November 2006,"Add the premium package just to get a freaking moonroof so the price is up around 34k. Not a bad deal.  But the massive discount off MSRP is scary. Why are they giving the car away?  Also, for 300 hp, the car is pretty darn slow."

The funny thing is the CTS-V is the same size as the G35 and Acura TL, both of which you guys say competes with the 335i. :confuse:  Leave your bias at home and recognize BMW, gets its butt handed to it on a Wreath and Crest platter. :mad:  Rocky"
2655,rockylee,November 2006,Well lets see what the AWD 335xi runs 0-60  Rocky
2656,dhamilton,November 2006,"could get a base 335 for 39k and change. You can't get a base CTSv for less than 50. Just going off sticker. RLee, your all over the place, and not making sense as usual. Keep up the good work."
2657,qbrozen,November 2006,"that's tough ... but my answer would be the same for both, regardless of what that answer is.  Why should size matter? The CTS is the smallest Caddy available, therefore its their entry-level car.  If we wanted to get real strict, then we'd exclude the S60 we've been talking about because the S40 is slotted beneath it. Likewise, the TL is excluded because the TSX exists. So where is the line?  Is it size? Is it price? Is it where it falls in the manufacturers lineup?  There are more cars here besides the 335i, folks. Not everything needs to be measured against that car. Some folks don't want to spend $40k on a car that size. End of story.  If I were to decide this talk includes the entry-level car from each luxo manufacturer, then, yes, the CTS is included. However, this also means the TL and S60 are excluded. If we decide all engine options for each car are included, then, yes, the 335i is allowed, as well as the CTS-V.  HOWEVER, if we decide on a price cap, that could be a whole different story. It would include multiple entries from the same manufacturer, while excluding some from others. It kind of sounds like that's what some folks are shooting for here."
2658,rockylee,November 2006,"Dan,  So now your bringing in prices to justify the 335i. My god talk about being all over the place. Who in the heck is going to buy a $39K 335i with vinyl interior ? $44-45K is what the average 335i buyer will spend. Dude seriously you are the one who doesn't make sense !!!! I can admit when I'm wrong. Some of you have to ""spin"" other peoples responses to justify to yourself worth ?  I'm not saying the CTS-V is a better all around car to own or drive but the test track results speak for themselves.  Rocky"

Entry-level sedans are in this range, IMO.  My list: - Manual gearbox available. No exceptions. - 6 cylinder engine or at least a turbo/supercharged 4 - Suspension that's sporty. Not a racecar, but better and stiffer than a Camry or Buick. - Not a M3 or a CTS-V or anything silly(that's mainstream performance - not entry-level). - Seats 5 in a pinch. Uuseable for families and as your only transportation. - AWD(full-time)/FWD/RWD - all legitimate choices. - Luxury doesn't just mean it has leather - it needs traction control, stability control, and so on. - Any car, even ones not at the bottom of a maker's lineup can be considered. - Size can range from compact to midsize as long as you can fit three kids in the back seat in a pinch. - $25-35K properly optioned out and delivered. 2006 models with rebates/incentives are okay.

2686,qbrozen,November 2006,"Actually if you actually read what Pat posted, this forum is meant for vehicles that are the younger brothers of their more luxurious siblings. Lincoln is not a luxury car manufacturer, it is a near-luxury manufacturer.  And if you followed the rest of that particular discussion, she said she was looking at those with a $50k car in the stable. Lincoln has one.  So drop this ""lincoln isn't luxury"" BS. If you want to exclude it, then so must you exclude Acura. They are priced almost identically ($28k to $50k). Lincoln is excluded for now due to lacking performance."

I don't think the inclusion of these features should be considered when pricing the car for the ""average buyer.""  Anyone who buys a Porsche, for example, knows to be careful with the options list. A $70,000 911 can quickly turn into a $100,000+ car just by checking a few boxes - with not a single performance upgrade among them!"""

You might add in the upper-end VWs, though - a couple of nice models appear every so often. If the 350Z had a back seat and four doors... There are a few oddballs out there that might fit in like this, so don't count everything out.  I think $35K is a good limit. $40K+ after delivery and taxes and such is really mainstream luxury territory. $35K also gives you enough room to add a few options and so on and end up out the door for under $40K.  IMO, the MKZ fits the category. The CTS does as well. I suspect even maybe one of the upper-end VWs also might make the cut. It's a pretty wide category, afterall."

2713,fedlawman,November 2006,"In my opinion, the reason why the MKZ doesn't belong in this segment is because of it's DNA.  The BMW 3-series was designed from the ground up to be a premium, benchmark setting entry-level luxury performance car. Every facet of its design, from engine, suspension, chassis, materials, etc. was conceived for the purpose of making the 3-series the most satisfying car to drive and own in this segment.  The MKZ, on the other hand, is a ""parts-bin creation"" conceived by Ford marketing to turn a 5 year-old, $18,000 Mazda6 into a $34,000 ""premium sedan.""  Don't get me wrong, I think the Mazda6 is a perfectly competent sedan - a reasonable alternative to the Accord and Camry. I just don't believe that a big V-6 and a sprinkling of pixie dust transforms the Mazda6 into a premium car."
2714,kdshapiro,November 2006,I think you have to define what you mean by some of your terms. If your idea of luxury is soft plushy seats vs the bolstering seats on the 3 series you should let us know. If your idea of performance is a mushy Lincoln ride vs the firm ride of the 3 series you should let us know. If your idea of performance is 0 to 60 that too would be a good thing to know. Is performance throwing the car around the curves and driving the car instead of being chauffeured by the car?
2715,ggesq,November 2006,"If I remember correctly, I did state IMHO (= in my honest opinion) when referring to the exterior and interior of the MKZ.  If that particular offering of Lincoln suits your needs and puts a smile on your face then great! It's your money and you should spend it on what makes you happy. I have absoultely no problems with that and I am not trying to tell you that you made a bad decision.  However, if you or anyone else wants to compare the driving dynamics of a 328 or a 335 to a MKZ and then say that it doesn't meet up to the performance level of the MKZ is ludicrous.  Bottom line- the host has excluded the MKZ from this discussion because it just simply does not belong here.  Happy motoring!"

I agree that the MKZ's appearance doesn't really have much appeal to a driving enthusiast, but it's target audience is undeniably ""entry-level luxury."" What we don't know yet is whether or not ""performance"" is part of the equation.  Doing even more research and giving the topic of the MKZ further thought, I realized that, although it has a lot in common with the TL (humble DNA, upscale features, etc.), the Lexus ES350 also falls into the same category.  Reading the Lexus literature and reviewing the ES350 here at Edmonds, Lexus actually advertisess the size of the brakes, presence of front & rear sway bars, and the fully-independant suspension on the ES350.  We all agree that the ES is not a performance car to be considered in this forum - but the TL is. The MKZ has the potential to be a TL rival at the test track given the sporting nature of the Mazda6 (especially when compared to the Accord), but until we drive the Lincoln, we just don't know.  The enthusiast in me is guessing the MKZ is probably a wanna be ES350, but who knows - the Lincoln LS surprised everyone when it came out..."

2753,plekto,December 2006,"So I finally sold my 67 Mercedes. It was a bitersweet parting, but a new engine was too much money - and it's going to Germany of all places. Some collector wanted it for a decent enough price, so at least it will get restored properly/live on.  But I'm now needing an entry-level sport sedan/coupe in the 5-8 year old range. I have the money, but I really only want to spend $12-15K.  Top of the list so far(all manual): - Older IS300 with. - Wide range of Mercedes. AMG and so on. Problem is that 8-10 years old is worrying me. I did see a couple of S500 coupes for under $20K, though...(grin) The C230K sedan also is attractive. Same as the C230K coupe, but a sedan. - Used CTS 3.6/stickshift - Celica GT-S(okay, kind of different, but sweet car anyways - only fwd car I really loved to drive) - Used RX-8. - Used BMW - no idea what models are reliable/good used. - Volvo S60/S70/C70 - T5 or R - Saab 9-5  The criteria in general is stickshift(non negotiable), RWD(Celica and Saab is about it, otherwise non negotiable) and a good engine. Supercharged 4, V6, etc. Inline 6 preferred, of course. Perhaps this is a new thread, but it sort of fits and well, creating a new one just adds clutter.  So.. same topic, used... what's the best deal out there?"
2754,robbieg,December 2006,"I am not the used car expert but I highly doubt you can get a CTS with the 3.6 and a stick shift for 15k,not to mention that one would be hard to find. With regard to the Mercedes. The S500 coupes are not stick shift. You probably would have to look at the C230 to find a stick and I bet one would be hard to find because I doubt that many where sold with a stick. A c230 coupe with a stick would be easier to find but that is a coupe. Also, I haven't priced RX-8s but I would guess that they are above 15k. The IS300 came in a stick starting in 2002 and one of these may slide into your price range. Saabs are definitely in your price range but do you really want a used Saab? With regard to Volvo, an R is clearly out of your price range. You may find a T-5, but, like the Saab, reliability may be an issue. I am not a BMW expert, so I will let someone else answer that one and let you know how old you will have to go to get below 15k. Also, if luxury isn't necessarily you thing, you may want to try a WRX."

2756,plekto,December 2006,"Well, this I know. A 2004 RX-8 is closer to $12K if you shop around, but first year cars are problematic. $15K can be had with some haggling on a 2005, though. Los Angeles is great that way - most everything sells for low trade-in(but dealers give you auction for trade-in as a result)  I searched nationwide on three databases and found *one* S500 Coupe from the mid 90s with a manual transmission - evidently brought over from Europe or something and converted to U.S. specs. Just got me thinking is all.  The maintainence is going to be rough on any large Mercedes, especially 9 years old. I even found a local dealer who was ""willing"" to let me have a 2001 ML320 for $9K(?) due to the horrid reliability. I passed, of course. I even looked at a couple of older 928s, but they are very very pricey to maintain. And 10-12 years old is more than pushing it for electrical and emissions equipment.  The T5 and R Volvos are only about 1-2K apart in value and they've been making them since oh, 1998 or so. I've had a sporty Volvo in the past and it was fun, but FWD and 200+HP isn't my piece of cake, either, given how Volvos have noticeable torque-steer when the turbo kicks in. Finding a S80 from Europe/Canada with stickshift is unobtainium as well. Maybe one every six months shows up for sale in the U.S.(only a couple of hundred over a decade were brought over this way via the European delivery program)  The CTS... yeah - $17K was the lowest I could haggle on one last week, but I just... I've been burnt by GM ""quality"" so many times... My last pre-Ford/still Swedish designed and built Volvo was bulletproof by comparison. Shoot, my dad just spent $750 on his old Buick for electrical. Now, it's been very reliable up until now, but the electrical/sensors on the engine are starting to go at only 8 years old. 3 coil packs, a new MAF, and a couple of other minor things.  The WRX is out. Sat in one and it was just nasty. Very much love/hate ergonomics in it. The Forester was fine, though. I just worry about reliability is all.(though my cousin's new WRX seems to be perfectly fine - and fast as stink)  BMW - my knowledge ends at about 1995.  Now if only something like the Celica existed with RWD, four doors, and had a back seat big enough to fit my 8yr old son. I'd SO love a 350Z if it had a back seat. Looks like it could easily fit one, but the geniuses at Nissan decided to fill the rear in with empty space/a shelf the size of a couple of huge subwoofers instead.  So far the C230/C320 is edging towards the top due to their poor resale value. :P $12995 asking price at about 5 local dealers for a 2003 coupe. The 230 sedan or 320 coupe is $15K - and that's before haggling.  EDIT: Concerning the BMW 5 series: 2000 528i $11,376 $12,975 $14,702 Like the price, but how reliable are they? Should I get the V8 model instead(though it seems awfully heavy at 3600+ lbs)"

Should I get the V8 model instead(though it seems awfully heavy at 3600+ lbs)""  The 2000 E39 is considered to be very reliable with but a few problem areas (ball joints, radiator and water pump) and even those have since been mitigated with replacement parts.  Given that my normal 12,000-15,000 mile commute year (a measure that had been very stable until June of 2005) has been upset (I've driven over 50,000 miles since that point) I'm looking for a 2000 528i 5-Speed with both the Premium Package, Sport Package and ""M"" interior (sport seats and steering wheel). Cars so equipped typically bottom out at about $14,000 and are very few and far between. The good news is that assuming proper maintenance by the original owner(s), these cars should be good for an easy quarter of a million miles without any significant maintenance dollars.  If/when I find one, the first things I'll be doing to mine will be to go through the front suspension, replace the water pump with a new all-metal one, replace the plastic tanked radiator with an all metal one (assuming this hasn't been done already), flush the cooling and brake systems, fit a set of low dust/dustless brake pads and new rotors, and any other cosmetic items that I find wanting.  Once gone through I figure I can get an easy 150,000 to 200,000 miles with only minimal (meaning scheduled) maintenance and few if any significant repairs.  Regarding the V8, fun though they may be, there is one key element that I'm having a tough time getting over. Even though both the I6 and the V8 engines are have aluminum blocks, the I6 sports steel sleeved cylinder bores while the V8 sports silicone impregnated cylinder bores. While I have no real proof of this, I suspect that the I6 mill will last longer.  Another thing to consider when comparing I6 to V8 engined 5-Series cars is the steering system. On the E34 and E39 models, there wasn't enough room to fit a Rack and Pinion system to the V8 models and as such they have a more conventional Recirculating Ball system. I much prefer the nimbleness of the I6 models due to their lighter weight and their Rack and Pinion steering.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2760,ggesq,December 2006,I finally got around to seeing Edmunds' video of the upcoming IS-F w/ 425hp. From my reading- it is postured to battle the upcoming M3. Is it true that Lexus is not putting a manual tranny in the IS-F?
2761,louiswei,December 2006,"Is it true that Lexus is not putting a manual tranny in the IS-F?  Unfortunately so far it seems like they are not going to put a manual tranny in and instead they'll use LS' 8-speed automatic.  Boy, is Lexus stuburn (or should I say stupid) or what? :sick:  Although hard to digest but I can at least understand not having manual tranny on the IS350. But I think not having it on their performance-oriented model (the -F series) is a dumb move to me. If the IS-F are not coming with the manual tranny then there is no way they'll put it on the future GS-F."

2769,esf,December 2006,"The new 335i coupe is simply the most beautiful 3 Series ever put in production. When it drives by, I feel like pulling over and admiring it as it drives by, as a sign of respect. Of course, I don't- but I'm aching for a 335xi coupe as my next winter car, if it ever comes out.  Now, I have a dilemma. Right now, I have an A3 as my winter car, but my son will be taking that in little more than a year and a half. The A3 is great as a commuter, and I know he'll appreciate it- but I want something more upscale for my next winter car. I'm going to end up with a BMW (90% sure). But, which one?  My wife has an SUV now (RX330), but we're custom-ordering an Audi A8 4.2 quattro for her next month, and her RX will be gone by the end of March. So, we'll be an SUV-free family.  What makes most sense in my situation?  3 Series coupe would be my choice based on style. It's more of a ""me"" car, and less something that I would shuttle family around in. I've also never owned a 3 Series, and I know it would be a rewarding experience.  The new X5 is very handsome, inside and out. Perhaps I'd get a smaller SUV (X3, Q5, GLK) if I was looking at one, but the X5 is tempting with its wealth of options and fantastic engine choices. It also may make sense to get this over a smaller SUV- I hate the X3, wouldn't want a FOURTH Audi in the family, and just can't see myself in a Mercedes.  I have a feeling the new 535xi sedan that's coming out could be the best compromise of both. It has fun-to-drive-ness that almost matches the 3 Series, and better practicality (keep in mind that I would not get a 3 Series sedan). However, a glaring flaw is the interior. IMO it's the worst of all the BMWs and has cheap plastics- I drove a 530xi for my wife before deciding on the A8 and wasn't impressed (7 Series doesn't come with AWD).  So, I don't really want to compromise. What makes more sense? 335xi or X5, in my situation?  Thanks.  '06 Audi A3 2.0T DSG &#149; '05 Audi S4 Cabriolet &#149; '04 Lexus RX330"

2771,nyccarguy,December 2006,"Well, if you REALLY don't want to compromise then why do you think you need an AWD BMW? Where do you live? Go for a 335i Coupe (RWD) with a sports package & 6-speed manual transmission. Get a set of 4 dedicated winter tires/wheels for the few months of winter.  An awd BMW will be heavier which will adversely affect braking & handling in wet, snowy, & dry conditions. Your fuel economy will also suffer in an AWD car vs. its RWD counterpart. The AWD BMW will also cost you more $ upfront.  You're worried about traction in snowy & icy conditions? An AWD car with 4 dedicated winter tires will accelerate better from a complete stop than the same RWD car with 4 dedicated winter tires. AWD may help you get going, but that extra 242 pounds (2007 BMW 328i vs. 328xi sedan from bmw na's website) could be the split second you need to stop from hitting a deer or swerve to avoid an accident.  Many people equate AWD with safety and therefore DO NOT put a set of dedicated winter tires on their AWD equipped cars. They feel that the all season tires equipped on thier awd car will do the trick. Do they wear the same pair of shoes to the office, formal function, the gym...? No. What is the only thing on your car that touches the ground? TIRES!"

2783,laurasdada,December 2006,"Louiswei brings up a very good point re: Cadillac in general: They overprice their cars. When I first looked at the CTS at the New England Auto Show when it was first released years ago, I didn't initially look at the Monroney. First strike was the exterior (imho a basically handome design then ruined by extra layers, shapes and a truckish front end). Strike two was the interior: cheap, cheap, cheap and incongruous. But, maybe the drive would be great (post auto-show). So, now to the sticker: Steeeeerkike three!!! $40k+. Crossed off the list, and on I went. But hey. It was a departure, and overall a good enough drive to be a winner for Caddy. But just think had they built the complete car and priced it a la Lexus back in '89...  I'm partial to the XLR. Unfortunately, wicked over-priced. Hence production was cut in half during its first year of production (if I remember correctly). Ths STS, yeah you know. Rebates, trunk money etc, etc.  I think the rebates/trunk money and general typical GM fire sales diminish the brand. Had they priced better in the first place...  But, otoh, Caddy appears to be on the rise. Competiton is good, maybe a rising Caddy will keep BMW/MB/Audi/Infiniti/Acura prices in check..."

The '08 CTS photos just posted show some hope but as laurasdada says, the pricing model will hinder sales again, as usual.  Regards, OW"
2787,louiswei,December 2006,"Maybe there is hope for Caddy if it can price the CTS around the Infiniti/Lexus range. Once the starting price of the bigger engine version (3.6L) is approaching $37K (335i territory) then it's all over.  What I would like to see is...  Small engine version (2.8L maybe?): Starting at $29K just to make a point that it's below $30K.  Big engine version (3.6L): Starting at $34K to undercut the IS350 and be competitive with the G35.  Standard equipments: Xenon + turning headlight, moonroof, push-button start, easy access, bluetooth, manual tranny, 18-inch wheels, DVD audio system.  I truly believe that if the above criteria can be reached then Caddy is going to have a winner in their inventory.

I declined to buy an Acura TL recently despite loving the size, driving dynamics (complaints about the FWD and turning circle are IMHO overblown) and interior of the car because every time I looked at it in my garage I would think I can't believe I bought an Accord! :sick: (Yes, I know the suspension, engine, gadgets, make it so much more. But, it looks like an Accord despite the body kit.)  I love the in your face exterior of the CTS. A lot of people don't like American styling. (They can buy the Mazda6 instead of the Ford Fusion or the Toyota Matrix instead of the Pontiac Vibe.) However, a lot of people don't like the exteriors of Japanese cars, either.  The only reason there's no CTS in my garage now is due to the interior. I can handle the angular padding on the doors and dash and the cheap plastic (the G35 has plenty, too), but that center stack instrument panel just hurts my eyes too much.  Pricing? Cadillacs were never cheap cars. IMHO, they shouldn't be. Part of the decline of their status of a brand in addition to the quality decline is the fact that there are so many cheaper, older ones on the road. In Europe, there are plenty of older Audis on the road (""Pimp My Ride"" and ""Top Gear"" showcase them all the time.), but I almost never see older Audis in the US.  Residuals? The CTS actually held its value pretty well considering it was an American car. (The STS? Ouch, 35K worth of depreciation in two years.) It actually did well in this class. The Japanese 3 (Acura, Infiniti, Lexus) in this class hold their values better than the European ones.  100mph in the 1/4 mile? Yeah, a lot of folks mentioned the rally cars. 50k?

The coupe handled great and was fat but wind noise was apparent and room and interior did not do it for me.  Cadillac lost some of it's appeal due to quality and image loss to the ELPS segment. The CTS is a nice try but as usual, missed the mark, IMO.  I did test drive the 300C SRT8 and it was great but mileage/residual was a killer.

2808,pearl,December 2006,"Thanks! I also subscribe to R&T and almost fell out of my chair laughing at this article. I suppose that if the only criterion is lap time, then the IS is not a bad car. But Heaven help anyone who actually has to drive one of these cars on a daily basis (and who is more than 5'8"" tall). This car is (pardon me) for midgets. It is a complete joke for even average size people to sit in unless they like to recline and practically lay down while driving. When I went to drive it, the Lexus salesman tried to steer me to a GS and said that the IS ""is a toy"". He was right."
2809,nyccarguy,December 2006,"So they could satisfy Toyota as an advertiser and not trash the IS350's soft springs, numb steering, artificial brake pedal feel...among other things vs. a BMW."
2810,dhamilton,December 2006,"I've tracked the IS at a Lexus event and found the same thing to be true. Numb steering, poor suspension set up. Under steers like crazy, and didn't feel all that refined to me. Oh well, one for the Lexus crowd, I wouldn't own that car if they gave it to me."
2811,louiswei,December 2006,"merc1, if you are going to critic R & T's comparo, at least watch their video first. In the video, they did not mention the reason that IS350 came up on top is due to the ""luxury"" factor."
2812,louiswei,December 2006,"But Heaven help anyone who actually has to drive one of these cars on a daily basis  I am 6'1"", 185 lbs and the IS fits me fine. BTW I don't consider myself as a ""midget"". In the states I think my size is about average and maybe a little bit on the tall side so if I can fit in there fine then it's definitely not a joke for your ""average size people"". Also, I don't lay down while I am driving."
2813,louiswei,December 2006,"So they could satisfy Toyota as an advertiser  You are right, the IS350 definitely has softer springs, numb""er"" steering and artificial brake pedal feel (whatever that is...) when comparing to the 3-series. However, what surprised me the most is that it comes out ahead of the new G35. Isn't the new G suppose to be the legitimate 3-series fighter from Japan? I almost cannot believe my eyes when I see that the TL-S beats the G as well. My expected ranking was suppose to be:  G35 > TL-S > IS350 (TL-S beats IS350 due to the manual tranny factor)  However, as one can see, R & T's ranking is exact the opposite. Now I can't wait to get my hand on the February issue."
2814,louiswei,December 2006,"Oh well, one for the Lexus crowd  Haha, it's about time...  I know the IS350 wouldn't stand a chance if it goes head-to-head with the 335i. However, it's good to know that at least one major car magazine thinks that it's the best Japanese has yet to offer. I haven't read the article yet (will tomorrow) but I think G35 will come up on top if they are considering ""performance"" alone. However, I believe it's IS350's overall package wins over the reviewers' votes.  For those whom have read the article, please correct me if I am wrong."
2815,joe131,December 2006,The previous generation IS was on the small side. I have not been in the new one.
2816,nyccarguy,December 2006,"be so cynical. Nissan & Infiniti spend a lot of $$$ advertising in R&T as well. I'll have to read the article, but I am shocked that the IS beat out a G35 Sport.  Happy Holidays Everyone!"

2820,louiswei,December 2006,"scottm123, if you must have AWD then I think your best choice (or best bang for the buck) right now is the G35x. No doubt the 335ix will be nicer and more powerful but that's if you can get over that price. I personally don't care much about the IS250 and would never choose it over the G35x. TL-S is nice but if I am going to drop around $35K on a car I'd like to have either AWD or RWD.  Just my 2 cents."
2821,nyccarguy,December 2006,How come you want AWD? What region of the country do you live in?
2822,scottm123,December 2006,"I'm in Massachusetts. I have a steep driveway, which goes up from my garage to the street, so there's no option of getting a running head start. I live in the backest of back woods, behind a beautiful golf course and I have a 45 mile commute down the dreaded Mass Pike. Anyone who drives the pike knows the nightmare it becomes when it snows. I have side road options, but they're also nasty when it snows.  I've had FWD cars for the first half of my driving life and went to 4WD for the second half.  I'm now ready to get back into a sports sedan, and would rather an AWD, than the FWD. RWD is just not an option.  I'm one of those people who love driving in the snow. When the first foot lands, I grab my coat and hit the roads. I'd like to find a car with a perfect balance of fun, power, and sensibility.  If the G is reliable and able to handle the crazy miles I put on each year, it may be my best choice.  I feel in love with the IS250, but I also have a moment once in a while where I want that thrill of power. Being at a red light and getting smoked by a kid in a Chevy Cobalt SS would not be a good thing, so the IS250 AWD is not an option for me... sad to say.  Wish the IS350 came in AWD. Same for the TL Type-S, but that's still a few years away."
2823,habitat1,December 2006,"scottm123,  Too bad Mercedes isn't offering the new E320 Bluetec with a 4-matic option. Although a pretty big jump in price, it would be my choice for a long distance commuter car under the conditions you describe. Great gas mileage and nearly 400 ft-lbs of torque to more than compensate for the added weight of AWD.  The unfortunate issue facing you is that NO AWD equiped ELLPS is going to perform as well as their RWD counterpart when it comes to taking on that Cobalt SS at the stoplight. All of them are hundreds of pounds heavier and give up at least some drivetrain efficiency, compared to running just the rear wheels. In some cases, the added weight also has a significant detrimental impact on the car's handling feel and nimbleness. Having received Audi A4 Quatro service loaners on a couple of occasions, I felt like I was carrying a car full of water buffalos compared to my TL. Great in the rain or snow, not otherwise. Needing AWD and wanting high performance does pose some compromises."
2824,kdshapiro,December 2006,"""Needing AWD and wanting high performance does pose some compromises.""  Unless we want to include Bugatti AWD as part of ELLPS.  http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=108537"
2825,ggesq,December 2006,"""Same for the TL Type-S, but that's still a few years away.""  AWD for the TL will show up sometime in 08 as an 09 model."
2826,kdshapiro,December 2006,"Could you explain the $10 difference you referred to? I just built a 350 MSRP for about $43K. The BMW that I wanted had an MSRP of $44K. How is that a $10K difference? If you paid $36K for your 350, you either got a heck of deal or you have a base model no options or a specially configured model. Add one option package on and the price jumps about $7.5K.  BMW allows one to configure the car exactly as they want. So my dream 335i would be $44K+ MSRP, only two thousand more MSRP $$$ than my E46, with more features and power."
2827,louiswei,December 2006,"I have a base IS350 and the only opted for the 18"" wheel and accessories. However, on the IS, the comfort access comes standard as well as real leather. Not to mention that the peddle shifter is standard as well. The configuration for the 335i I was referring to is: premium package + sports package + comfort access + metallic paint.  Premium package includes real leather, digital compass, bluetooth, heated seats, homelink garage opener and few other goodies. All those are standard on the IS except heated seats and bluetooth as I stated before.  Sports package includes 18"" wheel, paddle shifter(I want automatic so please don't bring in the ole' manual vs auto dicussion) and sports suspension. Again, as I said, the only thing that my IS350 doesn't have is the sports suspension.  Also the comfort access is standard on the IS and Lexus doesn't charge extra for ""metallic"" paint.  That being said the 335i comes to around $46.2K MSRP and the IS350 to around $36.5K (I got it for $35.5K). As one can see with all the packages added onto the BMW, the only extras it has over the vanilla Lexus are:  Sports suspension Bluetooth Heated seats  Are those worth $10K? Maybe or maybe not. To me? Heck no.  kdshapiro, let me know if you have more questions."
2828,jdelabre,December 2006,"Thats the same problem I had about the 335i. I want it loaded, and I figured around $48,000. In the coupe you MUST get the sport package! Those 18"" wheels are awesome. And premium pkg. and nav is also a must for me. Great car! TOO expensive for me. I went for the 07 TL-S. I love driving it. All my friends and relatives also love it in every way! I think Lexus are too soft and yuppy. If you get a loaded IS350 then its a drivers car, but then its almost as much as the 335i, which I prefer way more. I got my 07 TL-S Automatic, because its FWD. Loaded for $36,200"

2833,kdshapiro,December 2006,"This is an apples to oranges comparison. In real life on the BMW you need the SP to get the 18 wheels. To get the sport package on the 350 you need to add more than $7K. See I wouldn't opt for the 18 wheels or the SP, but would get almost else you mentioned. So in your world, it's a 10K difference, in my world not."
2834,kdshapiro,December 2006,"Rocky - What you keep missing is that all the world moves at the same time. BMW will be coming out with it's M3. If the 335 is an example of an underrated car, the M3 will be also. Lexus will be coming out with it's IS500 or whatever it calls it. The 335i mod chips will be arriving, which should provide a significant boost to the 335 hp and torque. The Nissan Skyline will be arriving some time.  From what I've seen, if you didn't like the CTS before 2008 will not make a difference. If you like the CTS now, you will probably love the 2008 CTS.

I want paddle shifter and 18"" wheel so I have no choice but to get the sports package (according to the BMW dealer). Personally I couldn't care less about the sports suspension. Like I said before and if you are here long enough you'll know that I am no where near an enthusiast. I don't care about heated seats and bluetooth either but since I want everything else in the premium package I have no choice but opt for one.  If you read my last post, I did mention that the $10K difference might be worth it for someone else but definitely not for me. Also, of course I'd use my point of view in my post, how you think in your world is none of my business.  Oh BTW, BMW charges $1,250 for the automatic tranny. I guess if they keep this up, I'll be driving Japanese for a long time to come..."

As blueguy noted, Dinan upgrades are warrantied, authorized and installed by BMW. I'm sure if you search around you will find horror stories, but for the most part, the chip makers find the balance between upping the performance and destroying the car."

2839,kdshapiro,December 2006,"""Maybe it's apples to oranges to you but for me it's apples to apples""  What makes the world go around is different opinions. I couldn't care about paddle shifters.

All I was doing is pointing out the 10K number is based on your preferences not mine."
2840,louiswei,December 2006,"Why I want 18""? It looks better.  Yes, I got a stripped IS350 but luckily the stripped IS350 offers almost everything that I wanted. It'll be perfect if it comes with Xenon. Don't need memory seats or auto wipers. Most importantly the stripped IS comes with comfort access and REAL leather. I wouldn't mind to get a stripped 335i if it's equipped like the IS even though it's $2K more.  By the way, I want everything in the premium package except bluetooth and heated seats so the ""want-$20-but-ran-up-to-$1200"" analogy doesn't make sense in my case. Come to think about it if I can get the 18"" without sports package I could live without the paddle shifter. But first I would like to find out how much is the stand alone 18"" option cost. If it's not far from $1,600 then there is no point. Of course it'll hurt the resale value and there's always someone wants a Lexus too, they are just not your kind of people.  ED sounds fun but it's just not my cup of cake.  I think we are all mistaken the point of discussion here. In my original post I wasn't trying to compare 2 equal-equipped IS350 and 335i. I was comparing my ideal IS350 to my ideal 335i. It turns out the IS350 for me is base + 18"" but the ideal 335i requires premium + sports + auto + comfort access + metallic. That's how I come up with the $10K difference."

A steering rack with less friction and more feedback would heighten our enjoyment. Body roll and structure flex distracted us with vibrations through the seats and floorboards.

2859,habitat1,December 2006,"Not to take sides on your debate with blueguydotcom, but after reading through these posts, I do believe that your personal price comparison between a stripped IS350 and loaded 335i is disingenous at best, deceitful at worst. Maybe not for you personally, based upon your ""ideal"" configuration. But that $10k difference that you come up with is not something that 1% of other buyers would ever experience - and claim that both cars are comparably equiped based upon their own preferences.  Also, although I knew you were less of a ""driving enthusaist"" than me (my manual transmission requirement vs. your acceptance of an auto), I didn't realize that you were that ambivalent to driving dynamics. If that's the case, I'm not sure why you aren't driving a TL, which would have saved you another $5-7k+ AND given you a boatlaod of standard equipment that the IS350 lacks. Apples to apples, that's the only $10k difference we have here, far greater than the difference between the IS350 and 335i. If the handling, steering and other dynamic advantages of that sport package equiped 335i are not worth anything to you, than neither should the fact that the TL is FWD be a detraction, given that its actual on road handling, steering, etc. is at least comparable to the IS.  In your cost comparison, what I would see as significant performance and feature differences are deemed irrelevant by you. Yet you are willing to pay more for an aesthetic wheel upgrade than I would have paid for on my ""other"" car. It seems to me that your cost benefit analysis of the IS350 vs. 335i is based heavily on image and not a lot on substance. Which is certainly your perogative, but I don't think it is typical of ELLPS shoppers. Certainly not the ones that are ""P"" oriented, but probably not even the ""L"" oriented ones."

Chassis engineering - at least as it applies to handling - is not one of them. It's likely to take longer than 2008 or 2009 for them to get remotely close to the class leaders in that dimension.

Typically, comparing the Treadwear Grades of tire lines within a single brand is somewhat helpful, while attempting to compare the grades between different brands is not as helpful."
2868,joe131,December 2006,"Tuner chips? Are they kinda like Tornado air intake mixers? Like the tuner's Honda Fit on Redline TV that got worse gas mileage than a Mustang GT? And which could only run on 3 cylinders? Hahaha! My guess is that the aftermarket chips cause more problems than benefits. Otherwise, why didn't the manufacturers just put the 350 HP chip in to begin with? BMW is not dumb. Capitalism. Its a system based on the old adage, there's a sucker born every minute. Or am I just too cynical?"
2869,kdshapiro,December 2006,"On example, tuner chips increase the hp and torque of an STI from 300/300 to 300/430. With a turbo it's much easier to get a performance bump than without a turbo."
2870,joe131,December 2006,at what cost and detriment to gas mileage and reliability? And do you lose any factory warranty if your motor blows up?  Ain't no free lunch.
2871,kdshapiro,December 2006,Dinan mods are fully supported and warrantied by BMW. Use of other tuners are at your own risk.
2872,ggesq,December 2006,"Some info about it I came across (Motortrend):  For the U.S., expect the engine range to be the C280 V-6 (228 horsepower), C350 V-6 (268 horsepower) and the C550 V-8 (380 horsepower), all with the automaker's seven-speed automatic. After a year a C55 AMG is expected. If the current German horsepower war continues, there's room under the hood for a C63 AMG, ready to out-gun even the upcoming V-8-engined BMW M3.  The new C-Class uses front strut suspension with two lower-arms, and a multi-link rear axle - familiar Benz principles. The main chassis innovation is a new type of amplitude-dependent damper, able to provide extra compliance over small bumps for ride comfort but stiffening up during bigger movements caused by sharp steering maneuvers. The system is entirely hydraulic - there's no electronic intervention.  The bodyshell is a claimed 13 percent more torsionally rigid than before, enhancing comfort by reducing vibration, as well as giving the potential for more precise handling. Around 70 percent of the new body is high-strength steel, which improves the strength-to-weight ratio. There is no significant aluminum in the body, and less in the suspension than competitors use."
2873,louiswei,December 2006,C550 V-8 (380 horsepower)  :surprise: :surprise: :surprise:  MB has truly gone mad...I guess they really want to take over the horsepower king title huh?
2874,habitat1,December 2006,"""MB has truly gone mad...I guess they really want to take over the horsepower king title huh?""  Not as ""mad"" as their AMG counterpart. They decided an R63 - 500+ horsepower minivan - is just what the neighborhood soccer mom needs. The should use Forest Gump as the ad man on that one. :surprise:  If the uber-horsepower addicted engineers at Mercedes/AMG would wake up, they would realize that the former C32 was already within spitting distance of the M3 in straight line performance, but light years away in terms of handling, driving dynamics and the real ""fun to drive"" department. So what have they done to fix that? Why add more horsepower of course. Like complaining to the restaurant waiter that your Salmon filet is undercooked and he simply refills your wine glass.  And louiswei, just to show fairness and consistency, I think AMG is considerably more abysmal than Lexus in their pig headed stubbornness not to engineer a manual transmission in ANY of their cars, period. Not a single one. What do they think? Us Americans (70%+ of AMG sales) can't count horsepower and shift gears at the same time? The SLK55 might actually be a fun car to drive if it weren't attached to a sloppy, slow shifting slushbox (in fake manual mode). The owner of my Acura dealer sells Mercedes and even he steered me to Porsche (and drives a Cayman S himself) :confuse:"
2875,kyfdx,December 2006,"This is a great idea!!  How about you let me drive your M3, while you are gone?"
2876,dhamilton,December 2006,"any of you rear wheel drive fans see the S6 come a tenth of a second behind the M5 at Button willow, and then ""beat it handily on a shorter figure 8 track?  Benz AMG vehicles are a joke, they are built for the rich guy with bad taste in cars."
2877,louiswei,December 2006,"habitat1, looks like Lexus is following MB's footsteps by not offering manual (not even SMG/DSG) on their -F series cars. Rumor has it that the upcoming IS-F might have 500 HP (previously reported 425 HP) but will be mated to LS' 8-speed automatic transmission. If Lexus won't offer manual on the IS-F then I don't like the chance of GS-F and SC-F getting it. Hopefully Lexus will wise up and decide to give their upcoming halo car, LS-F, either a manual tranny or SMG straight from their F1 cars.  Let me make myself clear first, I am not trying to defend AMG's decision on not offering manual on their entries, however I think there are at least 2 reasons:  1. AMG is more of a super luxury cruiser with sports aspiration. Those cars are not serious ""sports"" such as Porsche, Ferrari or even M and Audi's S/RS. Thus their targeted market is vastly different and mostly aren't interested in ""shift-'emselve"".  2. Americans traditionally buy more automatic than manual. I believe the auto-to-manual ratio for the 3-series sold in US is around 70-30 and this maybe your most ""sporty crowd"". Taking that into consideration I don't blame MB (or any other manufactures in this case) to not offer manual here on their cars. However, in Europe and Asia then that's a different story."
2878,circlew,December 2006,"Louiswei,  I think there is a dichotomy that the tuner teams at the respective manufactures are playing off of.  Some people define luxury as a slushbox vs. rowing in traffic jams and would never track their cars unless they could have a latte and be on the cell while their instructor drives!  The sport or performance set know how to make their rides do what they were designed to do and have fun driving.  The AMG guys and gals just want the designer set to have bragging rights! (IMO)  Regards, OW"
2879,blerner2,December 2006,"I went back to the BMW dealer today to test drive the 335i again.  The salesperson told me that while I could not switch the module to Sirius, I could add an aftermarket unit, hid neatly in the console and plug it into the Aux input that is located there. I would just have to install an aftermarket antenna.  After my visit at BMW, I went to a very reputable Audio installer, explained the scenario, and he said, ""I can't touch a BMW. They will void the warranty, if they find out that it has been added to the vehicle"".  All I'm looking to do is wire up the XM antenna and run it to the console, where I will have the aftermarket unit plugged in.  I'm going to be leasing this vehicle. Is this true, that I can't have this done without voiding the warranty? Can I ask the dealer if they will do it in their service department."
2880,louiswei,January 2007,"Allowing for a 15% driveline loss  Using the ""15% rule"", it'll be interesting to find out other ELLPS' dyno results as well. Maybe it's not only the BMW whom underrated its engine.  Edit: Found it, from www.dragtimes.com:  All stock configuration (with # besides the horsepower):  2006 Acura TL: 223.04 RWHP (= 262 HP before 15% loss, Official: 258 HP) 2007 BMW 335i: 275.89 RWHP (= 325 HP before 15% loss, Official: 300 HP) 2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe: 242.20 RWHP (= 285 HP before 15% loss, Official: 298 HP) 2006 Lexus IS350: 268.4 RWHP (= 316 HP before 15% loss, Official: 306 HP)"

2883,qbrozen,January 2007,"it seems turbo cars typically vary quite a bit from the factory. Turbos are also affected more severely by temperatures.  I don't doubt there is someone out there somewhere who finds their 335i to be 300hp, as the factory specifies. And maybe that's why BMW rated it that way. Just a theory."
2884,pearl,January 2007,"I am just under an even 6'0 and I cannot sit in the IS without my head hitting the roof liner, unless I RECLINE the seat a bit - which I do not want to do. Others I have spoken to have the same problem. Some of the ""fit"" issues have to do with torso length vs. leg length. I drove the IS and liked much about it, but it is just too small for me(noticeably smaller inside than the TL, G or 3 series). The salesman actually called it a ""toy"". I don't agree with that, but do think many won't buy it because they don't ""fit""."
2885,louiswei,January 2007,"The only complaint I have about the seating is that since I have really long torso, the backseat behinds the driver's seat is pretty much useless. However, I had that problem with my previous Accord too and I believe will have it in a G or 3er as well, just in different degrees. The only car in this class that will accomodate my seating position and at the same time to have a useful backseat could only be the TL (CTS might make the list too)."
2886,rockylee,January 2007,That is the main reason why I bought the TL back then. The CTS was my only other option when it came to room.  Rocky
2887,louiswei,January 2007,"Just got the February issue and here are quotes from the editors:  Sam Mitani, international editor: Now that I have a family, things like rear-seat space and ride quality are taken into greater consideration. But the hot-rod performance of the Lexus IS350 erased all my silly thoughts of comfort and civility. The Infiniti G35 Sport looks the best, and the Acura TL Type-S was the most comfortable and spacious, but it was the IS350's raw power delivery and sharp handling :surprise: that won me over. Now I need to come up with a good explanation to my wife and daughter, who may not share my enthusiasm for the car.  Jim Hall, senior editor: This Japanese trio is very good, but they still have little ways to go to unseat the sports-sedan kings, the BMW 3 series and Cadillac CTS. The Acura held up well against its new rivals. And the Infiniti has potential, but its steering is too heavy and the engine lacks grunt. Of the three, the Lexus is my choice, offering outstanding power, a surprising sporty chassis and decent steering feel :surprise: . Let's hope that Lexus goes to bat for enthusiasts and adds a manual transmission for future models.  Jonathan Elfalan, assistant road test editor: The G35 Sport is a blast to drive and best mimics the characteristics of a sports couple, but lacks refinement in its suspension and gearbox. However, when it comes down to it, the IS350 is the most cohesive and complete package with a very compliant chassis and well-sorted transmission-not to mention that it's a missile cloaked by an unassuming exterior. now if only I could order it with a manual gearbox.

2888,joe131,January 2007,"For the discussion, it doesn't matter if it is a chip for the 335 or some other BMW model. So the idea of mootness is moot.  You say you think you read (where?) that ""BMW will install and honor the warranty on after market parts in it's cars.""?  ""Honor the warranty""? Whose warranty? And who will pay for the repairs? BMW factory warranty? Aftermarket part maker's warranty? The car dealership's service department warranty?  ""Honor the warranty""? Well that is about as clear as mud.  What do you think that means? Do you think the BMW factory warranty is going to pay for repair and/or replacement of an aftermarket part exactly the same as if it was a genuine factory installed part? That is, do you think BMW will pay for the failed aftermarket part and for any consequential damage to genuine BMW parts of the car if caused by the failure of that aftermarket part?  Take a gander at that Bimmerfest message board. Some owners there have actually had the pleasure of dealing with parts failures and warranty claims."
2889,joe131,January 2007,"Hahaha!  ""...may affect...""?  So what if it is straight from Dinan? The chip may or may not affect the car's warranty. Big deal! That is hardly definitive, right?"
2890,louiswei,January 2007,"So what if it is straight from Dinan?  Exactly!! That's my point, even Dinan themselves cannot guarantee that if BMW will honor the warranty with the modification."
2891,joe131,January 2007,Well of course Dinan can not obligate BMW to warranty Dinan's chips. But the claim made earlier was that BMW would provide warranty coverage on Dinan's chips. That was the issue.
2892,joe131,January 2007,279 HP compared to 275? That's a little less than one and a half percent difference. Uh-oh! That Big 'n' Tasty is going to cost you $1.01 instead of $.99 now.
2893,fedlawman,January 2007,"If an Authorized Dinan BMW dealership sells and installs your Dinan parts, then you're covered. Period.  Time for my soapbox...  I would point out that even the factory warranty on an unmodified car can be ""muddy"" in certain cases. For example, if your clutch burns out after only 15,000 miles, is it a defective tranny or did you destroy it with abuse? This exact situation has happened to people on these very forums (including myself 2 years ago with my old Acura), and the decision whether the dealership covered the repairs or not seems to be about 50/50.  The parts and service folks at my local BMW dealer all know me by first name - and I've never spent more than $50 there at a time. I'm in there probably a couple times each month to buy a $6 oil filter, $3 worth of 7mm screws, or something like that. That's it. They always smile and say hello when I come in, talk about E30's for a few minutes, and then, half the time, they give me my parts for free. If it's not in stock, they have even overnight drop shipped parts to my home - no charge.  When I brought my Acura in with a moaning clutch 2 years ago, no questions were asked. The Acura dealer took care of me without hesitation. Other people have not been so lucky. Why? IMO, your automobile is one of your biggest investments, and like your accountant, lawyer, or bank branch manager, you should have a personal relationship with the people who help you take care of it. If you're an enthusiast (and what Dinan customer isn't to some extent), you should want to be an ""insider"" with the dealership people who are ""in the know.""  You'll never have a problem with warranty support, Dinan modified or bone stock, if you do this."
2894,louiswei,January 2007,"Interesting to point out:  IS350 won the comparo in both price independent and price dependent standings. Consider that it is $5K more expensive than the TL-S and $6K more than the G35S, all similar equipped.  This is one area which I don't really agree with the reviewers. I'd consider G35S the best buy among this group with price in consideration."
2895,ontop,January 2007,Interesting - a reply to your own post. Not feeling too loved?  OK - I'll pat you on the back.  You have a super car.
2896,louiswei,January 2007,"Nah, just finish reading the article and didn't notice it when I was typing the first post. Since it took a while so I can't go back and edit the original. I just think I should pointed it out for those whom don't have access to R&T.  Oh, BTW, none of the cars in this segment are super cars. Above average they all are, super car? Nah...  Like I said, the G35S is definitely the best buy in this bunch. If I am in the market right now for an ELLPS and must have sport suspension plus navigation then there is no brainer I would choose the G over IS.  That being said, the 3er is still the king among this segment (price independent of course). Can't wait to see a complete comparo later this year which includes the [non-permissible content removed] 3 plus the 335i and all new CTS.  Well, at least someone has to make an effort from preventing this place turning into the ""hail to the 3er"" board right? :P"
2897,ggesq,January 2007,So if you can't beat em join em :confuse:  Sounds like you have a lil bit of buyer's remorse :blush:
2898,joe131,January 2007,"You say, ""If an Authorized Dinan BMW dealership sells and installs your Dinan parts, then you're covered. Period.""  But did you ever have a serious engine damage warranty claim with your Dinan chipped BMW?  I did not. If you did not either, it might be better to talk to or read of those who have.  And standing on a soapbox does not necessarily lend credence to your speech, it just makes you seem louder."
2899,louiswei,January 2007,"So if you can't beat em join em  Uh...when did I ever join them? If you have been following my posts in this board you can see that I have never ignore the fact that 3-series is the benchmark of this segment. I just think IS350 suits my need better. Test drove the 330i at the time of my purchase and liked IS350's power better. Went to test the 335i over the holiday and loved the new twin turbo I6 and sharper handling. However still can't get over its hefty price tag and IMO ugly interior. Also, with the ECT power mode on, the V6 in the IS350 is very comparable to the 3.0 twin turbo.  Sounds like you have a lil bit of buyer's remorse  Be honest, I really thought I would if I go test drive the 335i, that's why it took me a while to hit my local BMW dealership. However, after the test drive (see above) I can say that I would still make the same decision this time around with IS350 vs 335i.  The only buyer's remorse (just a little :P ) I have is that I didn't opt for Navi on my car. Oh well, nothing a decent portable GPS navigation unit couldn't fix ."
2900,jblaze13,January 2007,"You are never going to convince the BMW lovers. If someone wants to pay that much more for driving dynamics that are marginally better and probably never to be used let them. Most consumers aren't racing their 3 series or G35 through the slolam and will never notice the ever so slight advantages the 3 series may have. What most consumers will notice is how much more passenger space the G35 has. They will notice how much less money it costs. The G35 is a better ""VALUE"". The 3 series is a more visually appealing vehicle. Many car magazines had the last generation G35 beating the last generation 3 series as well as other competitors. Check Car and Driver March 2004. It doesn't seem that this generation G35 enjoys such a feat but it is definitely right on the heels of the 3 series. My advice, buy the G35 if you don't need to say you have a bimmer."
2901,qbrozen,January 2007,"Many car magazines had the last generation G35 beating the last generation 3 series as well as other competitors. Check Car and Driver March 2004.  Oh... a 325. Gee... swell.  I'll agree, the G35 is a better value. But let's not go overboard here. Bringing up the 325 in a comparison of current cars is just silly."
2902,blerner2,January 2007,"I've enjoyed all of the lively debate in this thread regarding the G35 vs. 335i. It has been very informative to me, as I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to decide which of these vehicles to lease.  My question is, would some of you change your ""choice"" of vehicle, if you were considering the vehicles in a lease scenario vs. purchasing. I ask, as the 335i currently has a much higher residual and lower Money Factor than the G.  For a 3 yr, 15k/yr lease, the 335i is about $30-40 more per month than the G. I looked at both vehicles farily well contented and ultimately decided on the 335i.  My choice was the 335i, but my choice may have been different if purchasing."
2903,cdnpinhead,January 2007,"Either way, you still have to buy gasoline, and spending 20-25% less could matter. On each of my vehicles last year I spent ~$2K on gas, so $400-500 a year works out to ~$40/month. The Infiniti engine is a lot of things, but fuel efficient isn't one of them. The BMW gets kudos for mileage on a regular basis.  Sounds like a wash on the two leases when fuel is factored in."
2904,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"Do you negotiate on the car or is it ifxed price?  Negotiate. Get the wholesale cost (found at bimmerfest) and then talk to a dealer about a 800-1200 over ED wholesale price. That's his profit. You order the exact car you want and pick the exact day you will pick up the car. They give you a build number so you can check progress online.  two weeks before pickup, you go in and pay for the car - or sign the lease.  fly to munich, take 2 trains to the ED delivery center for 8 euro. a guy in a funny suit and sporting a silly accent explains the car to you, you sign some papers and drive out of a narrow doorway and on to either drop the car at the redelivery center or to the autobahn for fun.  I did this April of 2006. Spent two weeks touring europe in my 330i.  Next time I'll probably try the quick turnaround - leave sunday, arrive monday, fly home monday. No hotel, barely any food and I'll use frequent flyer miles."
2905,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"If someone wants to pay that much more for driving dynamics that are marginally better and probably never to be used let them.  Never to be used? My god, man. Why even bother with a G35 if you don't drive in a spirited fashion. Get an accord EX and save the 10k."
2906,louiswei,January 2007,"two weeks before pickup, you go in and pay for the car - or sign the lease.  What if I have a car to trade in? Do I have to leave it at the dealer when I pay for the car/sign the lease?  If I do then that's going to pose a problem since I have to do that 2 weeks before the trip and the car won't arrive until couple months after I drop it off correct?"
2907,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"Nothing is included in BMW's ED. Well, if you count 12-14% savings off MSRP as nothing.  Why would I want a few nights in a hotel on BMW? I stayed at the Munich Marriott for $50 a night when I did ED. I'll take 5k in savings and suck up the measly $100 I spent on a hotel in Germany for two nights.  Volvo's program gives you quite a bit. They're trying to move a product that is a salesperson's nightmare."
2908,blueguydotcom,January 2007,Never trade a car to a dealer. If you must trade a car - and surrender serious cash - then it's due when you sign. Never heard of someone doing ED and trading in a car but it's probably happened.  The car will arrive in 4-6 weeks. West coast is 6 weeks. East coast cars sometimes arrive in 3 weeks.
2909,booyahcramer,January 2007,"Everybody's splitting hairs about the costs of these 2 cars as if that's the only separator.  Having owned both, you can't say (without your tongue in your cheeck) the G has as good fit/finish/feel as the BMW. Period. It doesn't. And that's why the G will always be priced less, because Infiniti can't command the money BMW will easily get.  The G has power, but is a little rough around the edges and the brakes wear out VERY quick. I do like the new interior tho. BMW has gotten so ubiquitous tho. Still a great choice."
2910,jtla,January 2007,the automatic versions are much more comfortable in the seating dept.  Could it be that you were comparing the seats between Journey and Sport version of G35? I would think the seats in both Sports versions (auto and 6MT) are the same.
2911,louiswei,January 2007,"Okay, then that's a problem...  For ME, since this is my only car, if I opt to do ED 4 years from now I then have to pay for a rental car possibly up to 2 months. Guess what, that's extra money add on to ED + air fare + lodging as well.  Okay, here the thing, I am not trying to bash on the whole ED concept but just trying to point out that it is really not designed for EVERYONE."
2912,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"True. Not for everyone.  I'm used to living in households with more cars than bodies. Hell, my parents have 5 cars and there's only two of them!  Plus, I lease. So I schedule the next car to land here before my lease ends. Missed it by 4 days this time."
2913,jtla,January 2007,"How about RFT on the 335? From what I read on another board, the bimmer is going to cost much more in the tire department.  That said, I agree that the price difference between G35 and 335 becomes very little in a leasing scenario, especially doing the ED program. You then factor in the free maintenance and higher resale, I believe BMW comes out on top."
2914,bds92,January 2007,"Think me crazy. But I just don't see the point in buying FWD, an iffy performer and an iffy tractioneer, or messy iDrive. To eliminate the other possibilities, which are the 9-3, the C-Class, the CTS, and the IS: The CTS and IS are RWD. No good for my climate. The C-Class with AWD is far too expensive. The 9-3 has been taken over by the Americans, who have a reputation for ruthlessly poorly-made cars. Which leaves me with the G35x and the A4 3.2 Quattro, and since the two cars are so wonderful, I would choose the A4 only by a hair, because of the revolutionary AWD system that Quattro has become, compared to the weakling Infiniti AWD system, only available in two of Infiniti's passenger cars. Plus, the A4's much nicer looking, if it means anything."
2915,louiswei,January 2007,"To eliminate the other possibilities, which are the 9-3, the C-Class, the CTS, and the IS:  WRONG!!  Both IS and C-Class offer AWD. Okay I see you know that the C offers AWD but you don't like the price.  You forgot the 328xi as well. Not sure if BMW would offer AWD on the 335i."
2916,jtla,January 2007,"I have three little kids and a wife and I do not think it would be practical for me to fly to Germany to buy a car.  I have two little kids and a wife, but I am a newly convert to the ED program believer (thanks to blueguydotcom's analysis). True, it cost a lot to bring a family to Europe for travel. But if you are planning on a vacation anyway, then doing ED actually save you money on car rental. Even if you are not planning on Euro vacation any time soon, for your family just think of it as you going on a business trip. Like blueguy's plan, fly to Munich and back the same day, and save about $3k. Not too shabby for a day's work.  Just my 2 cents."

2925,kdshapiro,January 2007,"I think he was agreeing with my contention the interior of the BMW is superb for it's intended function, which I may add suits me just fine. While I wouldn't have used the word ""prissy"" to describe the Lexus interior I agree with the assessment."
2926,sprinkler13,January 2007,"not in the BMW...that is part of the cold weather package or as a standalone option. Trust me...I've been going back and forth for weeks now and if it wasn't for the fact that I'm eligible for the VPP plan on the G35, I'd still be deciding. BMW's finance numbers are so much better that the difference in the two cars ends up being around 70 bucks a month or so...factor in the free maintenance and the difference gets closer still. However, with my VPP discount, the difference will likely be more than that so it's worth it for me. Plus, I have been extremely happy with my 2003 G35 and really like the new touches in the 2007."
2927,designman,January 2007,"If you want to talk about driving, that&#146;s one thing, but BMW styling is the pits for the most part. Subjective, yes, but the current curlicue BMW interiors are NOT the paradigm of sport. If I bought a 335i coupe my first inclination would be to snip off the seat belt feeders with a pair of diagonals. That's some serious prissy."
2928,kdshapiro,January 2007,"Yeah, but on a regular basis I don't drive either looking at the seat belt feeders, admiring the seat belt feeders, or controlling the vehicle with the seat belt feeders. They have the same panache as cupholders in the back seat."
2929,louiswei,January 2007,"Love the interior discussion but since the BMW guys are in denial (haha, j/k), here's a new topic...  Why's that some cars' gas pedals are lighter/heavier than the others?  During my recent test drives I've notice that Acura and Infiniti have heavier gas pedals than Lexus and BMW. Infiniti has the heaviest, then Acura, Lexus has the lightest and BMW is somewhere in the middle. Come to think about it this phenomenon doesn't happen just on these ELLPSs. I remember my old Accord has heavier gas pedal than my parents' Camry and 4Runner as well. So I think traditionally Honda's gas pedals are heavier than Toyota's.  This could also explain why although the new G35 has 306 HP, it doesn't feel as punchy as the IS350.  My question is, what's the cause(s) to have some manufactures having heavy gas pedals and others having light ones? What are the advantages/disadvantages for each type or they simply doesn't matter?"
2930,designman,January 2007,"Yeah, but on a regular basis I don't drive either looking at the seat belt feeders, admiring the seat belt feeders, or controlling the vehicle with the seat belt feeders.  That&#146;s because your BMW doesn&#146;t have seat belt feeders. They&#146;re as obnoxious as a politician shaking hands and handing out leaflets at the train station the week before election day. Only it&#146;s worse. BMW gave us election day 365 days a year, 24/7 with that asinine feature. Everytime you go into the car it&#146;s greeting you."
2931,laurasdada,January 2007,"Since I do spend a fair amount of time driving my car whilst in its interior ( :surprise: ), an interior design, as well as suitable materials, that appeals to me is important.  To me, it appears that the Bangle-led design team spent so much time trying to ""flame surface"" the exteriors and tack on horrendous (in varying degrees, 6 series is the most egregious of offenders) bustle backs of the BMWs that the interiors seem to be an afterthough. Even a non-thought. The materials seem high quality to me, and if they were seeking a minimalist, blunt and totally Orwellian 1984, Apple Super Bowl commercial of many years ago function over form (and, yes, I know this is nirvana to some: BG.com comes to mind)interior, well then, kudos! Success. But, as I like to enjoy my surroundings while maybe not hustling through the twisty, rolling hills and switchbacks that Rte. 128 outside of Boston is so famous for (read: sarcasm! In other words, while sitting in traffic or at stop lights or just hiding from the family in my TL in the garage...), the artistry of interior (and exterior for the times I am approaching, washing or just lovingly gazing at my car) design, without noticeably compromising functionality, well then BMW is not so successful. I especially dislike the ""two hooded"" look of the main instument pod and nav/IDrive screen. BMW is not the only offender here, and thankfully it is an option on the 3.  I enjoy driving. I also enjoy the car as art (see Jaguar XK, Aston Martin DB9/V8 and, of course, Acura TL :blush: ). Each BMW Bangle design since the pre-freshened 7 series seems to be just a bit less of a Bangle design. That is good. But the interiors, to me aren't improving. To me. To each.  Peace on earth and goodwill towards men. Even Chris Bangle. :blush:  Oh, yeah. Almost forgot: Go Pats!!! Crush the Jets!!!"
2932,joe131,January 2007,"laugh at 'em if you want, but they sure make it easier to get ahold of the seatbelt."
2933,kdshapiro,January 2007,The lighter/heavier feel is the spring. Most new vehicles are drive by wire and the spring is built into the mechanism.
2934,joe131,January 2007,"I've never driven the Saab or the Lexus in the list above, but I'd bet the MazdaSpeed 6 would be a better entry level luxury performance sedan than either of them. Much faster than either and better handling too. And all wheel drive as a bonus. The Speed6 is pretty luxurious in the Grand Touring trim. Really nice leather on the seats. It's roomy too. MSRP is around $31,000 but selling for 10-20% less. 6 speed stick shift only. Anyone else drive one and like it?"
2935,nyccarguy,January 2007,"I'm not saying the G35 or IS350 are bad cars, they are just not for me. From what i've noticed reading these boards and from personal experience is that many people who are buying the Japanese Luxury/Sport Sedans are always defending their cars not only by singing their many praises (In their minds), but by many times saying that they could have bought the BMW but...  I've never heard it the other way around. Most of the people I know who own German cars love the way they drive and maybe they are not as ""perfect"" as their Japanese counterparts, but they don't long to own any particular Japanese make or model.  A few examples:  1. My best friend does a lot of driving (between 35,000 & 40,000 miles per year). He leases cars. Besides his personal car, he often drives family members' cars who are under their lease miles. A few years ago he drove his sister's E46 325iA with SPort Package for about 6 months. When the time came for his wife to get a car a few months after that, he got her a TL. He got a great ""deal"" on the car (a comparable BMW was much more to lease at the time due to an Acura factory program). Ask him what he thinks about the Acura. He'll tell you it has a nice interior, it is roomy and comfortable, and he likes all the bells and whistles. He'll also tell you it rides too soft, has terrible torque steer, & sloppy handling. He says he'd take the 184hp 325i (E46) over the Acura if he could do it all over again. Next time he's going German.  I have a friend who lives in South Florida. He and his wife moved there from Michigan. 6 months after they moved, she is getting her 330Cic serviced and is poking around the showroom. Falls in love with a White/Cinamon/Black Top M3 Cic. Started talking to a sales person. She took the M3. My buddy and his wife lost A LOT of money because she traded in the 330Cic (still had 1+ year to go on her lease) and forked over the HUGE security deposit from it as a CAp Cost Reduction on the M3 and to pay for the remaining lease payments on the 330Cic (plus I'm sure they were sold the car at sticker and the mf on the lease was bumped up). Her lease payment essentially DOUBLED. Guess what...They've got the car for 3 years and enjoy every second of it. No regrets!  I'm not saying to be stupid and break the bank or go in over your head on a car you can't afford. But if you like a certain car (say a BMW) drives, life's too short to compromise if you can afford it."
2936,shouldiwait,January 2007,"BMWs are over-rated cars except for perhaps the M3. I own a 2000 323i. Bought it brand new for $34000+ tax when it first came out. At 52000 miles, the oxygen sensors broke and costed over $500 to replace. At the same mileage, the high and low power steering pressure hose leaked, $300 to replace by a local mechanic. Wouldn't even want to think what the dealer would charge. Just replaced the back window regulator for $300. I am afraid the other 3 may break soon. At the current 67000 or so miles, I am about the replace a 3rd set of brakes. Keep in mind that BMW requires that you replace the rotors when the pads are changed.  Now let's get back to the current BMW 335 sedan. A fully equipped one in auto (premium & sport package, cold weather package and navigation) is close to $48000. Let's say that I can get $2000 discount, this is $46000 + tax/fees. I just bought a Type S for $35600 including (mud guards, wheel locks, rubber mat and trunk tray). That's over $10000 cheaper than a BMW 335. You do the math. I think both cars get the same look.  Forgot to add that I also got 4.9%. What I pay for my car is probably what some pay for the lease on the BMW 335."
2937,rockylee,January 2007,"And Rocky, yes I know the 2008 CTS will be da bomb both inside and out. There, just saved you a post.  I'm just glad you are becoming more open-minded :P  louiswei, based on what I've seen from the 2008' CTS it will be da bomb dog. :shades:  I know, i know the future is the future but in this case it's just around the corner.  Have a Gooden :blush:  Rocky"
2938,louiswei,January 2007,"Much faster than either and better handling too.  You are kidding me right? MS6 faster than IS350? In the recent R&T comparo, IS350 scores 4.9 sec from 0 to 60 and 13.5 sec to 1/4 mile. I would like to see how MS6 top that. Handling on the other hand, is a different ball game. However, I don't see how it can be ""better"".  Bottom line is, MS6 would qualify as an entry level performance sedan but falls short on the luxury part. Due to that thus not included in this segment."
2939,louiswei,January 2007,"Reasons why none-3er owners sometimes are forced to defend their buying decision:  1. Their car being bashed from 3er owners for something like crap, junk, piece of brick, etc... you get the idea  2. Recognizing BMW is the handling king doesn't mean I like it more than the others. I, for one (not speaking for others), does not purchase cars solely on handling.  3. To point out some other areas which maybe important to other people but often overlooked by the 3er owners. For example: interior styling, price and reliability.  4. Since 3er is the favorite, there's gotta be somebody out there cheering for the the underdogs."
2940,qbrozen,January 2007,Now if they could figure out how to get 250hp out of the engine  and mileage better than the mid-size SUVs i referred to earlier. ;b
2941,designman,January 2007,...handling alone does not performance make.  Yeah but it's thee most important part of performance in my book. I will sacrifice a LOT in power to get a car that is superior when doing the twist.
2942,blueguydotcom,January 2007,They'd be MUCH faster if they were 500 lbs lighter. And handle far better.  As for safer and roomier...uh I don't care. My car could have a 1 star crash rating. Really makes no difference in my selection. And as for roomier - my e46 was too big. The e90 is so massive I really can't understand how BMW can declare this Buick-like boat an entry level sedan. The thing needs flashing back up lights and a dumptruck beeper when in reverse.
2943,blueguydotcom,January 2007,The IS-F will be an AMG from toyota. It's not gonna be an RS or an M car. Not when you consider toyota's current offering. You don't take a lamb and turn it into a lion.
2944,jblaze13,January 2007,They were comparing both previous generation vehicles to each other. Maybe its silly to you but the 325 was underpowered and still cost as much. That was the point.
2945,qbrozen,January 2007,"i'm well aware of the point of the article. But I still don't see how comparing to the base engine makes the G a ""3-series beater."" Your post was quite misleading. 325-beater, yes, 3-series beater, no."
2946,qbrozen,January 2007,"that's fine. And I'm with you, to an extent. I'd still prefer not to be beat out by mom's grocery getter from a stoplight, though. I don't travel on very many twisty canyon roads ... come to think of it, i travel on NO twisty canyon roads."
2947,joe131,January 2007,I was only meaning the IS 250 and the Saab from the above list. The IS 350 does not come with a manual transmission. I am most interested in a sports/luxury sedan that does.
2948,joe131,January 2007,Is the luxury that is missing in the Speed6 subjective only? Or are there some luxury items you think should be available that are not? Seems pretty luxurious to me and is certainly a good performer. And a bargain.
2949,louiswei,January 2007,"We've been over this before many times, you can do a search on the previous posts. Other models also mentioned are Volvo S60, VW Passat and Subaru Legacy. I could have left out a few."
2950,joe131,January 2007,"I'm not wondering about them, only the MazdaSpeed 6 and what you think its luxury deficiencies are. Subjective I'm guessing, so never mind."
2951,qbrozen,January 2007,"volvo was agreed to as being included, AFAIK. But, yeah, i remember discussion about the Legacy and also the 300 most recently, i believe."
2952,qbrozen,January 2007,we've had discussions about setting objective parameters. just read back and your questions will probably be answered.
2953,habitat1,January 2007,"""I do typically stick to my purchases longer but the TL in my mind it is a dog, a dog I no longer want.""  Do you test drive cars, or just pop in to the dealer and say ""I'll take one of those?"".  You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but when I was sedna shopping in early 2004, I narrowed my choice down to a 330i ZHP, TL and G35, all in 6-speed form. I really wanted to like the G35, since I was coming out of a 1995 Nissan Maxima SE that gave me 150k trouble free miles. The G35 was a dissapointment. Power was comparable to the TL, but the engine was rougher under hard acceleration. Even more so than my 9 year old Maxima. I also thought I'd prefer the G35's RWD setup, but it didn't handle appreciably better than the TL, it's steering was more vague. The gershift was the biggest dissapointement - well behind the snick-snick shifting of both the 330i and TL 6-speeds.  I understand the new G35 has a lot of cosmetic improvemetns. I hope they also addressed my mechanical concerns. It wasn't a bad car - not a ""dog"" - but just very rough around the edges.  P.S. I hope you aren't going to tell me that any of the cars you had or are considering are automatics. If they are, you have no standing to call anything a dog."
2954,ggesq,January 2007,"""We mention it because in a straightline the 335i takes the IS350.""  That's exactly my point. When the IS350 first came out it set the ""benchmark"" for hp in this class and ""driving enthusiasts"" heckled Lexus fans about straightline performance.  Since then, BMW (& Infiniti) caught on that- hey- maybe we will lose market share since not every 3 series buyer/lessee tracks their car or drives like an 18 y.o. Now, BMW is back on top leading the hp war (IMHO) and 3er fans are drooling over themselves not only because of the bragging rights but also because it is a viable alternative to the current M3.  That said, I'm a TL owner with hopes that Acura will become competitive in the market again and offer something with equivalent hp and torque.  Not everyone buys these cars for what you and other ""enthusiasts"" buy/lease them for. You get to vote with your $$ and I'll vote with mine."
2955,joe131,January 2007,"Well, that sure cleared things up for me. I just re-read every post mentioning the MazdaSpeed 6 in the ELLPS board.  Here's what I've learned: Many people in here do not even know what a Speed 6 is and how it differs from a regular Mazda 6. There are no stated objective deficiencies that would keep the Speed 6 from having a well deserved spot in ELLPS. The ELLPS objective parameters do not have much to do with luxury or performance or MSRP, but apparently how the car sounds and feels to a particular poster. The (objective?) parameters have everything to do with the brand name of the vehicle and whether that brand name is normally thought of as a luxury carmaker and whether the nameplate has snob appeal.  Yeah, I think I get it now."
2956,qbrozen,January 2007,"you obviously didn't read (or even search for what we suggested you search for) and just feel like venting, so i'm not addressing this any more."
2957,ggesq,January 2007,"joe,  look at post 6900. IMHO the S6 is a very capable sedan but does not belong here."
2958,qbrozen,January 2007,"thanks for doing the legwork, ggesq.  i'd also suggest to read a couple of the subsequent pages to that post."
2959,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"Agreed.  Honestly, the more I drive my e90 the less likely I am to buy a 335i in 2008. The massive interior, total tonnage of the car and the cocooned/removed feeling is just too luxury/Buicky for me. I feel like I'm driving a faster, manual version of my grandfather's 1990s Park Avenue.  My ZHP was an outlier and it's becoming clear to me the entry level lux world has grown a tad too big and marshmallowy for my tastes/driving style/needs."
2960,pearl,January 2007,"Excellent post. Agree completely, and I own a BMW which I love and which has been the best car I have ever owned."
2961,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"And an extremely poor selling hanger-on that can be had for the low 20s. It's a screaming deal. Just not a fun car to drive. It's totally un-mazda-like in how it drives and feels (heavy, muted, slow-to-respond). Love Mazdas and the speed6 is the only Mazda I think just plain old sucks."
2962,dafreak1,January 2007,"Test drove the 335i today. I loved it, blew the G35 away. I have to have this car even though I was set to get the G35. Dealer told me 1K over invoice for the sedan and 2K over for the coupe. I cant find invoice pricing on the coupe though so I am not sure where that pricing puts me. I am a little leary though after reading the overheating problems with the 335. Anyone have any real world experience with this issue? What an awesome machine!!!"
2963,louiswei,January 2007,"Hey dafreak, what happen to ""the best value"" :P  No worries man, just playing with ya. I like the 335i too and definitely would pick it over the G if price is not too much of a concern."
2964,dafreak1,January 2007,"Well, I still think the G35 is a great value. I was surprised at how much I liked the BMW though. It felt more solid to me and more fun. It left me not wanting all the luxuries of the G35 whereas the G35 made me want them in the BMW. I am not sure i can explain it correctly but there definitely is a difference and I will probably end up paying the extra money for it."
2965,louiswei,January 2007,"Oh of course you'll have to pay extra bucks for it.  What kind of package does the one has that you have your eyes set on?  I am also expecting an ""I told you so"" post from either blueguy and kdshapiro in the near future. :P"
2966,dafreak1,January 2007,"Not sure yet, weighing the options. Any suggestions? Also, am I better off leasing or owning? I can do either but it seems that most people lese BMW's."
2967,louiswei,January 2007,"Maybe those BMW guys have better answers for the leasing/buying question. However, as for me, I don't do lease, but apparently it's a very popular way to own a BMW.  As for options, it depends on what you want. Navi? Heated seats? Sport suspension? Auto/manual? Real leather? I am pretty sure you would want comfort access right?"
2968,dafreak1,January 2007,"My last two cars have had navi so I would like it although I am willing to give it up. Heated seats, yes. All 335i's have sport suspensions (I think). I would not add the sport package though as it would change my tire set up (I live in Chicago). Auto. Dont care about the leather. Comfort access would be nice too. I need to figure outthe best configuration."
2969,louiswei,January 2007,"Not all 335i have sport suspension. I test drove 2 335i last week and one of them don't have it.  I guess your best option is:  comfort access + cold weather package + sport package + Auto tranny (paddle shifter only comes with sport package).  If you need bluetooth then it'll be like:  comfort access + cold weather package + sport package + premium package + Auto tranny.  Add Navi to each setup if you wish.  BMW website has a very good ""build your own"" function and I strongly suggestion you to check it out."
2970,dafreak1,January 2007,"Yes, on BMW site now. I am pretty sure all cars come with sport suspension and that the sport package is the option."
2971,louiswei,January 2007,"Here are what the Sport Package includes:  * Star Spoke (Styling# 162) light-alloy wheels, 18 x 8.0 front, 18x 8.5 rear; 225/40R-18 front, 255/35R-18 rear run-flat* performance tires* * 8-way power front sport seats (includes 2-way headrests and thigh support) * 3-spoke leather-wrapped multi-function sport steering wheel with audio and accessory phone* controls * Sport suspension calibration"
2972,dafreak1,January 2007,"Ah, I have been configuiring using the coupe, you the sedan. All the coupes have the sport suspension included but not the sport package."
2973,habitat1,January 2007,"After all this debating ...a slushbox in a 335i? :surprise: :confuse:  Come to DC and my 8 year old daughter will teach you how to shift. She mastered in in my former S2000 from the passenger seat when she was 4. You'll have to work the clutch, but she never missed a 1-2, 2-3, 3-2, 2-1 shift (the most I tried keeping within my 25-30 mph limit).  Now I know why you didn't respond to my last post. Of course a TL automatic is a dog. But what is your excuse for going with slush in a 335i? It's got the best 6-speed in the ELLPS segment. I suspect even the GEICO caveman could shift it in his sleep."
2974,dafreak1,January 2007,"You make a me laugh. I love a manual and it is what I grew up with and most of my cars have been such (not my last two). However, there are a couple of reasons for looking at the slushbox. One, my wife (unfortunately) does not know how to drive a stick. I have offered to teach her and she gives me that look. In the end she would let me teach her. With that in mind the performance numbers between the slush and the stick are such that there is no real reason to go with one over the other, other then the pure enjoyment of the manual. I would love to get the stick but do I give up the car if I can't?"
2975,dafreak1,January 2007,I like the configuration without the slush though. I can everyhting else I want for under 45K.
2976,laurasdada,January 2007,"""Of course a TL automatic is a dog.""  Wearing my GEICO caveman costume while leaning on my slushed TL I am giving you a look of disdain...  ""Of course a TL automatic is a dog.""  Yes, a sleek, slick, (and non-abused, of course) fast Greyhound. With perforated leather seats and a great stereo!"
2977,shouldiwait,January 2007,"You are a little misinformed. It seems quite proper to compare one sports sedan to another, same category and class seems fair to me. You are biased when you thought your TL was faster and handles better than the Type S. The latter has more horsepower and has a revised and improved suspension. I had an S2000 and yet I thought this Type S handles quite well. As far as it feeling slower than your TL, you must allow a car to break in a little to feel the added power- perhaps after 5 or so thousand miles. In addition, I think you felt restraint from pushing when you test drove it and I am sure you did not use the paddle shift sport mode.  Regarding the FWD and RWD comparison, the latter generally handles much better. However, you need to read the upcoming Road and Track magazine on the IS350, Type S and the new G comparison. The Type S actually did very well.  My main point is about what you get for driving experience/pleasure and money. I am very happy with my decision. I still own the 2000 BMW and I would not buy another BMW from a financial standpoint. I am a lawyer and can easily afford a 335 but logic tends to dictate my decision."

2979,blueguydotcom,January 2007,Thank god my fiancee can drive stick. I suggested gettinng DSG on my next car for her. She promptly drove my 330i manual for the rest of the day and told me she may own two automatics but she can do manual if pressed.  Two best reasons to pick the manual: 1. Cheaper at purchase 2. cheaper to repair - thousands cheaper. A bad tranny today costs 4-6k to repair. A bad manual - less than 1000.
2980,merc1,January 2007,"By the way, R&T's editors apparently agree when they rank IS ahead of G35S and TL-S in both steering and handling.  I'm still in shock over that one considering Road and Track's usual preferences. I see the IS350 put up better slalom numbers than the G35, as did the TL-S. Interesting indeed.  I do like the IS350, but this IS-F is just plain ugly IMO.  IS-F  The new CTS on the other hand looks pretty good.  M"
2981,habitat1,January 2007,"I'll bite - I think that front end style is ostentatious at best hideous at worst. Did all of GM designers flunk out of Mattel Toys school of design? From the front end, I expect the driver of such a car to be a ""Rock em Sock em"" Robot.  I thought Bangel took the 5 series in the wrong direction a few years ago. But it looks like a flowing work of art compared to the CTS. The CTS front end has all the elegance of a snow plow. I'll ask back - do Cadillac purchasers need to be reminded every time they look at their car of their own ""Blockhead"" image?"
2982,dafreak1,January 2007,"I have to agree, the CTS has to be one of the fugliest cars on the road. I wouldnt touch it with a ten foot pole, no matter what kind of numbers it puts up."

2984,qbrozen,January 2007,"If you need bluetooth ...  just wanted to point out that, according to BMW's site, the list of standard features on the 335i includes bluetooth."
2985,habitat1,January 2007,"""I believe dafreak stated he lives in Chicago. Our traffic is plenty reason to stray away from the manual.""  No, it's not, IMO. If you enjoy driving a ELLPS, there is really no excuse to get it in an automatic if you are physically capable of driving a stick. If the traffic is that bad and your daily commute that tedius, IMO you should get a bloody Prius, save yourself a bundle, and use your savings and tax credit to get a serious ""fun"" car like the Honda S2000 for the weekends.  We live in DC and until our 2005 MDX, neither my wife nor I ever owned an automatic (combined ages of close to 100). My wife likes a manual not because she drives like Danika Patrick. She just likes the feeling of direct control and no unexpected upshifts or downshifts. The XC90 V8 we also considered had an automatic with a mind of its own. Her first choice would have been the X5 3.0 6-speed, but it was too small. We came out of a 1996 Isuzu Trooper 5-speed which she put 80,000 miles on. In her opinion, there is nothing about the MDX which isn't light years better than the Trooper, except for the transmission.  But hey, it's your money. I would just find the idea of an ELLPS and an automatic for me to be a sure sign that I had gone bipolar and needed Prozac. Fortunately, so far, no such inclinations."

On the other hand, if I limited my social network to those who only drove manual transmissions, I'd hardly have any friends. So, while were are talking amoung enthusiasts, non-enthusiasts or bi-enthusiasts, I'll keep shouting support for the often misalligned manual transmssion. I'll give grief to those who think it's too much trouble except under perfect driving conditions. And I'll continue to spit out ""slushbox"" every now and again to make my point more dramatic.  But I know some damn good people out there that drive automatics. And I am sure I'd be lucky to count many of the folks in this forum among my friends, automatic drivers included.

3012,shipo,January 2007,"""They have to soften them up to accomodate the low-profile tires.""  I read a study three or four years back that tested a couple of different cars with wheel/tire sets ranging from 16"" through 20"" (all with the same rolling diameter as the factory spec for the car, and all roughly the size of a typical 3-Series BMW wheel/tire) to see if they could quantify the better handling aspects of larger wheels and lower profile tires. IIRC, the rather surprising result was that 17"" was deterined to be the optimal size, and beyond that, the extra unsprung weight started negatively affecting the handling characteristics.  I have no idea if suspension tuning combined with light weight wheels (expensive) and tires will offset the findings of the study that I read, but there it is.  Best Regards, Shipo"
3013,designman,January 2007,"IIRC, the rather surprising result was that 17"" was determined to be the optimal size...  Yes, that's also what I've heard from the track rats and the E46 3-series.

I don't think BMW has gone to that extreme yet with the suspension and I think I would choose the smallest wheel I could get on a E90/92 3-series... without runflats of course.

Bling laden? :surprise: Those are fighting words! :mad:  Seriously though, my (bling-less) 2005 911S w/ 19"" wheels and 295/30 series rear tires does not ride much harsher (with PASM set on normal) than my 2004 TL 6-speed w/ 17"" wheels and 245/45 tires. And it rides much smoother, with no more body roll (i.e. none), than my friends former 2001 996 Turbo with 18"" wheels and 285/35 series tires. A few rides and drives in that 996 Turbo required a trip to the dentist to have my fillings reset.  That said, I would agree with the general comment that many, if not most, manufacturers have not advanced their suspensions to the same degree they have increased their wheel size. The former involves real engineering, the latter appeals to image over substance. In the ELLPS segment, only BMW, in my opinion, has the suspension to match anything larger than 17"" wheels.  P.S. Louiswei - all in good fun. Even I thought my old Supra on 14"" wheels looked out of proportion. Within 3 years they were up to 16's or 17's."

I think AWD at a 100-300+lb disadvantage is NOT a good tradeoff in a sports car or sports sedan.  But your claim that 50 lbs makes a ""big difference"" in the handling and road feel of a 3,500+ lb sport sedan is taking the point to the extreme. Not on any public roads, and probably not on a track. If it did, the car couldn't even make it around a corner loaded with 4 passengers.  As far as noticing 10 lbs in the trunk, double bull. Unless you have that bag bouncing around in .8g slalom turns, and hear it, there isn't a human being on earth that could tell it's there. The fuel tank in my 911 holds 16.8 gallons = 135 +/- lbs. I can tell the difference between full and empty, but not between 9/16 and 5/8. Crap, I've lost 8 pounds since the holidays and looking to drop another 20. I hope to feel a lot better driving my 911 if I get get my 6-pack back by spring, but the car won't perform any differently. How much does Schumacher weigh, anyways?  Congratulations on your recent engagement. Perhaps your post is attempted justification for you and your fiance to drive around naked, but I don't really think you have science or engineering on your side.  P.S. The lighter is better principle is one I fully agree with. The issue, IMHO, however, isn't that a 530i weighs 44 lbs more than a 330i, it's that a diminimus sized IS350 sedan weighs over a quarter ton more than my 5 passenger 1995 Nissan Maxima. 3,500 lbs seems to be the new standard, compared to 3,000 not that long ago."

I do appreciate how leather smells, but I'm guessing (as was pointed out, with respect to ""wood"") that, at this price point, real leather & real wood are well out of reach -- what we get is a pale imitation. Surprisingly (or not), that's adequate, most of the time, to keep the cars selling.  When Infiniti presented a real (non-shiny) wood finish in their M series, many didn't like it.

Real leather is solid and if you get a rip in it, it's all the way through the same, like say, ripping a cotton T-shirt.  But the real stuff costs about 800-1200 per car in actual labor and materials - before profit and such is factored in.

3044,rockylee,January 2007,"habitat1,  I want to rephrase myself. I understand what you are saying but their is more to a ELLPS than just driving dynamics. IMHO that's all that BMW knows how to do very well and they sell many for that reason along with people seeking to buy for the badge. I however think theirs much more to car than strictly handling performance. Honestly how many people are going to take their BMW's to the track and use all that handling performance ???? Are you going to race louiswei, around a track in his IS350 ????? I personaly would rather enjoy the creature comforts of a IS350 that has 90-95% of the 335i's performance every day than have a car that is a great performance machine but does nothing else better than the competition let alone better than the gadget filled IS 350.  If you want a performance machine their are better alternatives on the market which are cheaper to own and operate. A couple off the top of my head is the STI and EVO if you wanted to stick with a sedan. The next EVO, like I said is IMHO a ELLPS even though this board and host doesn't recognize it as such because it's not a luxury brand and that's okay. I personally think the best ELLPS on the market with price not being a factor is the Lexus IS 350. Obviously, that will change come this summer with the new 08' Cadillac CTS which should be the best but we won't know for sure until all tests have been validated. #2 should be the IS 350 #3 is a toss up between the 335i or G35 based on if no chages are made. I know the car mags don't agree with me because they are gear heads but I'm factoring everyday use as a daily driver and can't knock louiswei's decision one bit for wanting to own the best ELLPS on the market IMHO.

3046,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"Rocky,  Do you derive any pleasure from driving? I do. I look forward to driving. It's not a chore. It's not a have-to. It's a desire, a longing, almost an addiction. Coupled with that need is a strange desire to always draw the perfect line on a corner. It could be a simple 90 degree turn or a banked 270 degree corner that I take daily. The line, carrying speed through it, transitioning the weight just right, nose pointing in the perfect place for exit. I get ultimate glee from the ""perfect corner"" or taking a series of Esses just right.  Unfortunately, lifestyle demands a 4 door with room at least a little room. I demand xenon headlights, leather and some sense that the car i'm in wasn't built for someone working at target (Subaru, Mitsubishi) That's why I drive a BMW. The only other guys who come close are Mazda - not the Mazdaspeed6. VW is a distant third.  Everyday, I drive my car. how it handles is of the utmost importance. You seem to prefer passively piloting. to each his own. Most people drive like they're dead; if I drove like them I might as well have a banal auto-equipped 03 Camry 4 cylinder then."
3047,pv2,January 2007,"Blueguy, Great explanation of enthusiasm in daily driving. No need to push the absolute limits of the car but enjoying the experience and the skill to do it well (a little like golf; you're really competing with yourself). I enjoyed the 2 BMW coupes I've had but practicality dictates a 4 door (2007 Acura TL-S) and FWD for Northeast winters (though this year has been an exception). Using enjoyment and enthusiastic (but not dangerous) driving as an evaluation mechanism allows for a lot of individual choice in ELLPS (among the agreed brands). Many of the cars would be good choices but personal preferences, price, etc., make the equation different for everyone. Enjoy your daily drives; I certainly do. Jack"
3048,merc1,January 2007,I almost became breathless reading that! Very passionate. What do you think about BMW bringing the 1-Series here? It is smaller than the 3 and even more fun to drive then the 3-Series according to most of the European press.  M
3049,blueguydotcom,January 2007,"Very interested. 300 hp turbo, easily tuned to 350 or more, 3000 lbs...so much potential."
3050,allargon,January 2007,"I will now briefly interrupt discussions about leather, Cadillacs, BMW's, Subaru's and Mazda's :confuse: to mention that Edmunds posted an article about the new C class today.  http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=119252  The article says the car is a little higher and shorter than the one it replaces. Darn! My main beef with the C class (besides the perceived lack of reliability, uncompetitive powertrain and high price) is the lack of cabin space for even the DRIVER."
3051,m1miata,January 2007,"At one time, it seemed like the Japan makes were looking European. Now it seems like the Euro cars are turning Japanese. Oh maybe not - I'll rest my eyes and look at it again tomorrow :surprise: At least the Cadillacs look unique. -Loren"
3052,habitat1,January 2007,"""...but their is more to a ELLPS than just driving dynamics. IMHO that's all that BMW knows how to do very well and they sell many for that reason along with people seeking to buy for the badge.""  Quality driving dynamics and precision engineering are infinitely more important to me than the difference between BMW leatherette and Cadillac leather. As for ""that's all BMW knows how to do""? What planet are you living on Rocky? BMW's can be equiped with virtually all of the luxury amenities a normal person could ever want. And style is highly subjective.  As for those seeking to buy the ""badge"", let's cut to the chase on that one. GM lovers should be envious of the BMW badge. Better yet, they should learn from it. It represents more than a half century of dedicated commitment to producing some of the finest engineered cars in the world. As, by the way, does the Porsche badge. BMW earned the right to ""badge"" loyalty. GM, on the other hand, did everything possible to piss that kind of quality engineering heritage and customer loyalty in the gutter. You yourself can't proudly live in the present. You are always promoting that the next thing to come out of Cadillac will be ""the best"". Wishful thinking - but one thing is for certain, brand loyalty doesn't work that way. If you've screwed up for a couple of decades straight, you either need to fold your tent or be prepared to do it right for a consistent decade or two before arrogantly thinking that you deserve any brand loyalty. That's how long it took Audi to overcome their debacles in the 1980's.  Lastly, please don't speak for me, Louiswei, blueguydotcom or anyone else in this forum when you attempt to proclaim the ""top three"" ELLPS's. That's your opinion, which you are entitled to have, (despite, IMO, your warped metrics of ""gadgets"" being king). I think most of us here are mature and intelligent enough to come to our own opinions and conclusions without the benefit of your ""obvious"" proclamation that the next Cadillac will, finally, be ""the best""."
3053,circlew,January 2007,"Listen, I was a GM loyalist, switched to Lincoln and finally gave up after many decades. First GM in my family was a '56 Chevy Belair.  I agree with habitat regarding the ""toilet"" treatment and arrogance regarding any need to change to market dynamics or to recognize the reaction from customers as their products suffered from real and perceived quality/value degradation. That was/is the mentality of some of the large car manufacturers today as well (Merc, Watch Out!...don't get Chrysler fungus). Bleeding quality and loyalty led to the current state of affairs for the US contingent. Yes, they can and will turn around because they can no longer exist by the ""driving by looking in the rearview mirror"" mentality. The past is gone. The competition is better. Time to get real.  Heck, if my GM car performed close to this BMW I own, you think I would not line up again and again? When you expect a certain level of return in any investment and there is never a smile on your face anymore, loyalty evaporates. As to the gadgets, give me a break! The parts bin at BMW is a couple of steps up from the best US has to offer, hands down.  Regards, OW"
3054,plekto,January 2007,"Considering the crud BMW made for a decade after WWII like the Isetta, yes, BMW has ""earned"" their reputation.  But they aren't the only competition in town anymore."
3055,laurasdada,January 2007,"From these initial pix, I agree. Although I see Korea, a hint of Kia??? Will reserve final judgement for the real world, but so far I'm more impressed by the new CTS. And I hated the current CTS (exterior/interior style-wise)."

3057,m1miata,January 2007,"Out of curiosity, how did you like the Eldorado and Seville design of 2002 say? Perhaps it is just me, but I kinda like the simpler looking BMW, and Mercedes cars. Some of the more busy looking cars, with some odd lines and creases in the body works kinda remind me more of some odd things from Japan and Korea over the years. Or perhaps some of the very strange things out of Detroit. While some may find the CTS a bit much, as in too radical, you have to admit it is sharp, and will be something in a car museum and car shows within a couple decades. While it is a bit alarming at first, this Art & Science look, it doesn't come off to me as off balanced as say the Bangle butt on a 7 series BMW. The less radical forms of the Bangle are kinda interesting. On some models of BMW it is starting to look OK. All in all though the appearance of some German cars is starting to blend now with the Japan makes. And I hope the headlamp craze gets toned down some day before they overtake the whole car. Some day the size of the lens will exceed the hood width! And some are long too --- too long!  OK, a quick stupid question: Do you prefer the look of the Azera to the Sonata? Is it me, or does the Azera look older. I am NOT saying it looks bad, but rather the dating of the look a bit say early 90's. Anyway, is it better looking or just larger? Any vote for it being included with entry luxury? Is it there yet? -Loren"
3058,plekto,January 2007,"The *only* option you need is the 3.6 engine. If you want to get it with an automatic, you really just need to resign yourself to an AARP card and get a DTS.  The radio - aftermarket. Always been true for any GM product.  Don't forget the end of year incentives and 0% financing - that's a huge plus as well."
3059,readerreader,January 2007,Yup. It's exceptionally detailed. Look at the compound C-Pillar!:        I like Bangle-Butt though.

3061,blueguydotcom,January 2007,Acura and Infiniti has sporty sedans.  What are you talking about? :confuse: The guy asked about sport sedans.
3062,goddess_1,January 2007,"I know, I know! Sigh. But, the TL burns a little more fuel (mpg), has a BLACK steering wheel (hello - I live in the SW, and is tacky against the tan interior I like!), and sets my heart aflutter even less than the Volvo. Lexus body styling is all fad, not classic enough. Infiniti gets crappy gas mileage. I see old MBs and Volvos all over the place -- they can't be THAT bad for the long term . . . I guess I'm arguing more with myself than with you! The feedback is appreciated."
3063,blueguydotcom,January 2007,You're buying for body style? Okey dokey.  All the cars in this group get crappy mileage. They make big claims but the reality is that very few will see more than 22-23 on a normal day.  Volvos and MBs of the 1980s were made during a different era. Today MB and Volvo are part of american car companies and their quality reflects that.
3064,gooddeal2,January 2007,"My uncle used to have a '93 Volvo 740 Turbo and I can say that it had more problems than any other cars that we ever owned, Toyota, Lexus, Nissan and Infiniti.  Styling? I think…only those in the 50s and up or very conservative people who like MB or Volvo."
3065,goddess_1,January 2007,"Hah! Not even in my 40s, buddy - I just happen to have discerning taste for classic styling! :P If I'm going to spend more than $20K for something, I should at least like the way it looks. Or, at least not hate the way it looks. Otherwise -- and I absolutely mean this -- I would rather not buy ANYthing. Which is why I still have the car that I have . . ."
3066,frisconick,January 2007,"I lived in Phoenix for a while, and the color of the steering wheel man meaningless if your car is baking in the sun. I literally used oven mits at times to drive sometimes."
3067,pat,January 2007,"It would be good if some of you could respond to goddess_1's specific question - she said she wanted to choose between the MB and the Volvo.  I know there are reliability questions for both brands and that she said reliability is a priority, but now that you've all told her to pick something she wasn't asking about , maybe you could give her some feedback on her original question."
3068,habitat1,January 2007,"Fair enough, pat.  goddess_1 doesn't want to experience pain (excessive maintenance and repairs over 8-10 years), so she's asking us which is better, a sharp stick in the eye (Volvo) or bamboo under the finger nails (Mercedes). I too might have suggested a third or fourth alternative that required hardly any spilling of blood whatsoever, but if those are the only choices, I'd vote for Mercedes. I know a lot more people that have eeked 130k miles out of Mercedes than Volvos without getting nickle and dimed (or dollared) to death. And they look better in the process. But with either one, I'd be tempted to get an extended warranty.  You might want look at the used car lots of your local Mercedes and Volvo dealers for 6-8 year old specimens and think about which you would have been happier with, had you made this decision in 1999. I suspect Mercedes."
3069,louiswei,January 2007,"If money isn't an issue then I'd go with C280, otherwise the S60 isn't too bad of a choice either. It's a toss-up IMO honestly. Make sure you go with your heart not your brain so you won't have buyer's remorse in the future.  I used to like Volvo back in the late 80's and early 90's but now whenever I see a Volvo I see a glorified Ford. :sick:"
3070,fedlawman,January 2007,"Only the new Volvo's have Ford DNA in them (mostly it's Ford's borrowing from Volvo DNA).  The S60 is a 5 or 6 year old platform (MY2001 I think) so that argument is moot.  I also don't buy into the whole reliability argument. Maybe the Japanese cars have a very slight edge in ""predicted reliability"" over the long haul, but all new cars today are pretty darn reliable. In all likelihood, a new Volvo or Mercedes, if properly maintained, will make just as fine a 10 year old car as a Honda or Toyota.  I work for a federal government agency, and we have a fleet of about 60 American cars assigned out to us. We keep all of these Dodge pickups, Ford Explorers & Tauruses, Chevy Luminas & Blazers, etc. for 7-8 years and 100,000 miles. In the 13 years I've worked for the feds, I've never seen a single car go out of service due to catastrophic mechanical failure - and we drive these cars hard. I've had more than a dozen cars assigned to me over the years, and I've never had a major breakdown. In fact, after I surplussed my M-B S420 last fall, I was assigned a beautiful '99 Ford Taurus. I've had it since July and so far, it's tight as a drum and trouble free.  I'm certain that a Mercedes or Volvo, driven normally and maintained properly, will provide years of reliable, comfortable service. Don't get sucked in by all the anecdotal hype you read here and elsewhere. Cars are machines designed and built by humans. No car is perfect, and any car can have it's share of problems. Buy the one you like best and enjoy it."
3071,louiswei,January 2007,"after I surplussed my M-B S420 last fall, I was assigned a beautiful '99 Ford Taurus.  Just out of curiosity, how did you go from S420 to a Taurus? Are both of them provided from your agency?"
3072,ricka1,January 2007,"Drove the 07 TL and G35. The TL handled nicely even with the FWD. The G was somewhat tighter. Both had nicely appointed interiors. The TL is somewhat wider on the inside but not by much. My issue is the trunk. Didn't have my clubs with me but when opening the trunk--especially the opening--the G35 looked pretty small. The salesman said a full staff bag will fit though. Any golfers have an issue with this? I carry my bag a lot due to the job. Even if that fits, doesn't look like much else would.  I want to like the G35 because its styling looks sleeker than the somewhat bloated appearance of the TL. Since I buy a car about every 6 years it would feel good getting something that looked new.  I could use some help on this before trying the golf bag test myself."
3073,ivan_99,January 2007,"If I were looking at a MB280 and wanted to keep it 8 years, I would wait and get the 08.  The current C class came out in 2001…so 8 years from now in 2015 you&#146;ll still be driving a car that (looks wise) came out 14 years earlier (there&#146;s classic…then there&#146;s dated).  I don&#146;t think the 280 engine has had a major overhaul…but it does deliver 30 more hp; so you may have to deal with first year model issues (but that&#146;s what the warranty is for).  If I were going the S60 route I&#146;d go with a 2 year old certified…you can save a bundle…"
3074,goddess_1,January 2007,"Pat - thanks for focusing!  Fedlawman - you said what this teeny, tiny voice in me was saying, but it was getting drowned out by the clamor of negativity & doubt (my own!) It's exactly what I needed to remind myself of a mistake I made years ago with a similar issue -- I bought a condo I hated that made ""good"" sense, then regretted it until long after I sold it. For many, there would have been no regrets, but I'm unequivocally my own person(!) who should know by now to listen to my instincts. Even when those instincts are about the size of an amoeba.  So, here's what I'm going to do . . . I'm going for the MB or Volvo from whomever offers me the fairest deal and does so without the schmooze and hi-pressure sales pitch. :P I'll let you guys know what happens . . . should I (or they) survive the experience."
3075,louiswei,January 2007,"goddess_1, you can be really aggressive for the MB since the new C-class is just around the corner."
3076,sprinkler13,January 2007,"In the sedan you should have no trouble with a golf bag. I had a 2003 G35 sedan and I was able to fit all of my hockey gear in there, and that was 2 full bags (one for goalie gear, one for regular gear), and a set of goalie leg pads, and the all my sticks running thru the pass thru. I now have an 07, and while the nav/6 disc changer takes up a bit more space, I have easily been able to fit one of my sets of gear and have room to spare. It might not fit both sets anymore, but I rarely need them both so it's a non-issue. Golf equipment shouldn't be a problem either."
3077,fedlawman,January 2007,"""how did you go from S420 to a Taurus?""  The Mercedes was a seizure. The Taurus, like 90% of our cars, was a GSA purchase. I don't work the street any more so no more cool seizures for me.  ""you said what this teeny, tiny voice in me was saying""  You'll get good advice here, but most people think of a car as an appliance to get from point A to point B. For most people, an Accord or Camry is all the car they'll ever need, so choosing the Lexus or Acura is a no brainer. You, on the other hand, have expressed some feelings about what you want. For you, you deserve a car that makes you feel good.  FWIW, I had a 2001 Volvo V70 wagon (purchased CPO in 2003 with 23,000 miles on the odo). The car was totaled after my wife was struck head-on by a van going 40 MPH. We didn't give it a second thought - replaced it with a new 2004 V70. Luxury package, rear-facing 3rd row jump seats, and 16"" alloys where the only add-ons. Smooth ride, quiet interior, luxurious appointments, high quality materials - best minivan I never owned. I'm a very satisfied Volvo owner."
3078,pat,January 2007,"Heh, listening to one's own instincts is a lesson too hard earned, I completely understand! Let us know how it goes."
3079,qbrozen,January 2007,"so i take it you have driven both, right?  what you didn't share is what ELSE is important to you besides reliability.  The C280 and S60 are very different cars. The S60 is a bit bigger. If you get a T5, its definitely faster in a straight line. BUT, its fwd. The C280 will have better resale ... but in 8-10 years, that's not going to matter very much. Either car will only be worth a few grand, at best.  I'm surprised ... no, shocked ... they are the same price. Considering benzes are more new and have better resale ... are you sure you are looking at comparable vehicles and you KNOW the real price on them (not asking prices, as, in my experience, volvo dealers ask WAAAY more for their used cars than they are worth)."
3080,nyccarguy,January 2007,"pat, I think gas is cheaper everywhere else besides California & NY (a close 2nd).  merc1, I've always loved the stunning good looks of the CLK 430 especially with those 5 spoke AMG wheels. My Mom had a '98 CLK 320 Black/Black (with the sort of cheesy looking wheels that looked good on the black car). My Dad saw the car featured in Autoweek in August of '97 and ran down the the dealership the next day (a Saturday after work) to place his deposit. He's not that type at all, but was just in awe over the car's looks and had to have one."
3081,merc1,January 2007,"Needless to say I've been a fan of the CLK430 too!!

My bet is that plekto is thinking of an SLK, which was initially launched with a slushbox only, however, after nearly getting myself fired from MB-USA for my disparaging comments about the lack of a manual gearbox, the folks in Montvale did ultimately decide to put a third pedal in that car, as it should have been from the very beginning. ;-)  Best Regards, Shipo"
3085,habitat1,January 2007,"I'm with merc on this, I am almost certain that the CLK never came with a manual transmission.  I did drive the SLK 320 6-speed in my sports car shopping period of mid 2005. Are you sure thats not what your co-worker has?  P.S. ""Quick as a Porsche"" is a pretty broad statment. The base Boxster has a tough time beating 6 seconds in a 0-60 run, the 911S has been times as low as 3.9. Unfortunately, that SLK320 6-speed I drove was closer to the base Boxster. And the SLK55 forced you back to the automatic transmission."

I'd like to name more, but I'm figuring you'll be on the unemployment line long before you get through the above. Actually, make the Bluetec first, as a ""sport"" version 6-speed would be the most interesting MB I'd consider buying in the near future (so I can keep my 911).  P.S. I concede you beat me by a couple of seconds, but don't extrapolate that to mean an automatic is faster than a manual!"
3088,shipo,January 2007,"Hmmm, I thought everybody around here knew that I used to work for MB-USA. :blush:  Maybe you missed the following post from nearly two years ago. ;-)  shipo, ""Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedans"" #6085, 3 Feb 2005 2:09 pm  As you can see, when I said ""...after nearly getting myself fired..."", what I really should have said is ""...after nearly getting myself fired on the spot..."", my stay of execution only lasted about three months. The folks in Stuttgart wanted me to stay on, on their payroll, however, two months after the SLK incident, my wife gave birth to our second child and there was just no way I could spend the next several years flying back and forth to Germany. Geez, if they'd offered me that gig when I was single, I'd have been all over it like shine on a polyester leisure suit. :P  Best Regards. Shipo"
3089,habitat1,January 2007,"Shipo,  That's a great story. And worth re-posting in the ""Future of the Manual Transmission"" forum.  I too wonder in other areas whether it's ""conventional wisdon"" or just plain arrogance that perpetuates some bad business decisions. One could conclude today that, of course, Mercedes' buyers want automatics, because anyone who wants a stick has self selected out of their customer pool. But, if I'm not mistaken, the 3-series crushes the C class in sales and the M5 beats the E55 in resale value.  A friend of mine bought one of the very first E-classes around 1988 and ordered it with a manual. The dealer tried to forewarn him about resale. He responded that he'll just have to take it to a BMW dealer when he was ready to trade, down the road. :P  Take care."
3090,cdnpinhead,January 2007,"Don't forget that the C230 & C350 are available with a manual six-speed. I didn't realize it myself until ~a year ago, when it was pointed out & later verified (by me).  There are other reasons the 3 series moves more vehicles than the C class, however. It's certainly reflected in my short list for my next car -- the 3 is on top & the C is at 3 or 4, depending on my mood that day."

And they are right, people do not drive sticks much in USA, so most all the sales would be in automatics. And I am sure it is a fun car to drive with the automatic. Rack and pinion steering would have helped. They offer the CTS with a stick, yet I have yet to see one on the lot. And if you bought one, it would be hard to resell. I have a stick PT right now, and I bet I take a lickin' for choosing that. The gas mileage is better, but most people do not want a stick or can not master the manual tranny.  They had a waiting list for buyers of the SLK, so they made the right choice in the package, wouldn't you say? That is from a dollar stand point. One problem is going to be bad press, with only an automatic. The test drivers love to point out cars with an automatic only as being one which is not a true sports car. So what? I bet more women than men bought them, and that 90% of all buyers of a Mercedes would expect an automatic. Now a Miata is a different breed. Those are more like an MG class of car where the buyer expects to see the stick in there. Do they sell many BMW3 cars with a stick? -Loren"
3095,blueguydotcom,January 2007,Do they sell many BMW3 cars with a stick? -Loren  Yes. I know very few BMW 3 owners with an automatic actually.

Some dealers don't even have manual in stock for test drive. One can say that all the 3ers with stick are sold, but the reality is that the majority of buyers want automatic. With their few stick-shifts in stock, for those manual tranny buyers the chance of getting the color/options they want is slim to none. Therefore, they end up special ordering them, which is what I will do."

There were things that I noticed back in 2004 when comparing the G35, 330i and TL 6-speed that may not have mattered to others. Example, coming out of a Honda S2000, I was spoiled by perhaps the best short throw gearbox in any car. Both the he 330i and TL 6-speeds were very good, but the G35 was below average (at that time, hopefully improved since).

Personally, I use Tomtom with a PDA for work and it gets the job done for my travels around the country and outside it.  That said I'll probably pay for my fiancee's next car to have built-in navi.

Having something that's always on and pointing her in the right direction = peace of mind for me.  In some instances in-car navi can be useful. For the most part I think it's an exceedinly overpriced toy with limited functionality:$300 in software and parts that the manufacturers mark up to 2k. And it can only be used in the car; as we travel out of town mostly by plane, I fail to see the day-to-day value.

The TL screen is 9"", the MDX is 8"". Even the grossly overpriced, hard to use 911 screen is 6"", with very good resolution. The portable units I've seen have 3-4-5"" screens that are pretty poor by comparison. I'm sure they've improved, but I still confess an economically irrational preference for an aesthetically attractive functionally integrated factory system.  For what it's worth, I have plopped my laptop in the passenger seat of my 1995 Maxima with a $100 DeLorme GPS unit plugged into a USB port.

3153,habitat1,February 2007,"One thing I will grant you is that at least if a Garman malfunctions or dies after a couple of years, you can either get it replaced or toss it and get the latest and greatest.  Our MDX was in service for a total of 3 days dues to a haywire nav system. Showed us paddling in the Atlantic on the way back from Boston to DC. It took a couple of attempts to fix it, finally achieved by replacing the entire disk unit under the seat. Under warranty and my wife got a new 2007 MDX as a loaner, but still a pain in the butt. And what happens if the screen goes dead in year 5 or 6 of of our planned 7-8 year ""buy and hold"" strategy? I'm a little surprised there is no difference in the cost of an extended warranty for the various MDX (or TL) models even though ours has both the Navi and rear DVD/Entertainment systems and both are covered. While my 1995 Maxima runs like a top mechanically after 12 years and 155k miles, I think I've been through at least 5 desktop/laptop computers during that time.  In the case of the 911, there was no box to tick. I took an in-stock car for $10k+ off MSRP when local dealers were barely discounting an ordered car. So even if it goes dead, I'm well ahead dollar wise."
3154,rvator4,February 2007,"I have to agree with you. I have a TL with nav and I would never purchase one again in the car. We have used it soooooo few times. I will buy a portable one and take it from car to car from now on. Like someone else said, when it becomes std equipment for 400 extra, I might consider it. The portable one in my airplane sure gets used a lot though. Never leave home without it. Stay out of those controlled airspace areas."

Both of those allow playing of DVD movies through their center screens.  MP3s? MP3s on CD or an AUX jack. All of the ELLPS play MP3 CD's. Current CTS's don't do this without aftermarket. This will be resolved for the 2008 model year.  Premium sound? That's highly subjective. Toyota has a premium sound 9-speaker JBL option on the Prius. It doesn't even include a subwoofer.  Dallas?

If you are talking about mainstream luxury performance cars(note the lack of ""entry-level"", then you've come to the wrong discussion. Complaining that the CTS and MKZ don't ""fit"" - they plainly do. Welcome to the bottom-end/entry-level of luxury performance cars.  IIRC, based upon the original posting, this comes down to: - 25-35K after rebates - definately not $40K+, that's the next level) - has more luxury than an Accord/Camry/Pontiac/etc. - has a sporty suspension and good handling. Well, better than a Buick or Camry in any case. - manual transmission is an option. - No convertibles. 4 doos preferred - 2 okay if it's like the old 2-door Volvo sedans(it's the exact same car as a sedan, just with two doors instead of 4). No hatchbacks, crossovers, or simmilar, of course.  Pretty much anything else is okay. Note the utter lack of FWD/RWD/AWD, size(within reason - a DTS isn't going to really work - lol), or brand. Traction control, stability control, navigation, alloy wheels, leather... also not on the list. Nice, but optional.  A base 3 series is acceptable, for instance - the upper-end 3 probably not, though - it's just too expensive for a first time buyer in this segment to usually buy. OTOH, if BMW is running a killer financing program that get the upper-end 3 series down around the same payments as $35K...  Btw, yes, the MKZ technically fits here. It's not what most of use would LIKE to see from Ford as an effort, but it passes the required minimums."

Look at it like this: Camaro - Killed - Resurrected Firebird - Killed, Grand Prix - Never developed - Killed, maybe resurrected? Ford Taurus - (considered the SHO but abysmal quality track record). - Killed - Resurrected as 500?  There is no lifeline to truly evolve each model and keep loyalty!

You'll note that the Saabs and Volvos pretty much can come with stick, though, so many of them would qualify. A nice step above your typical car.  The Grand Prix with the V8 certainly has the power and suspension to qualify, but it's eerily like the RX-8. It's a blast to drive, but utterly fails the ""luxury"" part. It's most like a entry-level-plain-as-vanilla-sports-sedan. All function and nothing nice about it.  Nothing anout it where you grin a bit to yourself knowing you have a better car than most people AND one that you could feel okay with having a vallet park it.  GM - other than the CTS, isn't doing very well here. Few manuals, and either it's de-contented to the point of rental-fleet starkness(and leather seats alone don't fix this - something Mercedes should note with its C-Class lately), or it has suspension that's as soft as a NERF toy.

I agree the badge is the only thing it's missing from making it a ELLPS. I guess if you care more about product than the badge the choice is clearly easy between these two. :shades:  You know, you could fire up your own thread and include whatever vehicles you want in that discussion  Yeah I could but why ? I enjoy this one way to much. You could also do the same. :blush:  Almost every manufacturer has an option for leather, having a leather option with some hp behind it doesn't make that vehicle an ELLPS.  Well that is true and I agree it takes more than just leather and power to be a ELLPS. I often think some get to caught up with badges instead of letting the product do the talking. I do see good product coming from non traditional luxury brands giving the traditonal luxury brands fits and my links from above is just one example.  Rocky"

3177,plekto,February 2007,"It all goes back to the original sport sedans, the original BMW 2002 and 3 series, more than 30 years ago(almost 30 for the 3 series).  It must be built to be luxurious, smaller than a Buick/midsize car if possible(though modern technology has enabled larger cars to qualify, smaller and lighter is always preferred), handle well, and have a manual gearbox.  The IS350 becomes just another luxury sedan. And it costs a lot more than $40K by the time you get it out the door.  CarsDirect Price: $37,140 - this is a stripped, no options base model IS350. It's clearly moved itself out of this segment. You'll never, ever find one, though, without at least 2-3 option packages, so $40K is closer to a realistic price."
3178,kdshapiro,February 2007,"ummmm... i thought that was his point. ""If it had a badge OTHER than pontiac"" ...  Badge like what? Lexus? The interior photos shows an ugly interior. IMHO."
3179,qbrozen,February 2007,does it matter? his point was simply that pontiac is not a luxury brand. he admitted that in his original post. not everything has to be a war.
3180,plekto,February 2007,"Yet its clear that cars get a bit less expensive every generation as well - at least in be entry-level of each segment. You can thank Hyundai and others for putting pressure on the older players.  Afterall, the price increase on a base CTS isn't hardly a blip. The next one may be a little more money, but certainly not 3-4K more.  I think part of it is that $40K+ still sticks in most buyers' minds as ""wait a second... that's expensive!"" - certainly to people lokoing for ""entry-level"" anything."
3181,ggesq,February 2007,"Buying a 35k-45k ELLPS is not just about making the purchase. People have to factor in TCO. In reality, if folks are taking a second look at the ""price"" then they really shouldn't be looking in this segment."
3182,dfc3,February 2007,"Whereas I agree that $40,000 shouldn't be a ""cap"" anymore... maybe something like $45,000 should. As a Mercedes-Benz C Class owner, the C350 (with options) can still be had for well under $45,000, but not under $40,000. I'd imagine the BMW 3 Series would fit the same bill for the best engine/package in the line."
3183,plekto,February 2007,"That's just plain silly.  It says at the top of this page: Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ncal_id=1223979&car_id=209707423 So tell me why this shouldn't be included as well. It's brand new, and it's under $43K.(a 2007 is $48K, btw)  I can hear it now. Everyone crying ""foul!"" while at the same time saying that the upper-end/more powerful versions of the Lexus, 3 series, or C-class somehow should be allowed. ""But it's not entry-level"".  And neither are the high-performance versions of the 3, C, and IS, either. $40K is a good limit because it takes almost of these souped-up sedans out of the competition. (and technicaly, you can get a 338i for under $40K - so no whining - though it's clearly NOT BMW's entry-level offering, it does squeek under the line)"
3184,joe131,February 2007,and VW is not a luxury nameplate and Passat is not VW's entry level sedan either. Sorry. Don't mention it in here again. Passat fails to make the grade.
3185,joe131,February 2007,"yeah, these 3 are entry level sedans within their luxury nameplates' offerings. Well, the IS250 is, and the IS350 is pretty much just an optional engine in that entry car. Price does not determine whether its an ELLPS."

Just because GM products have their value fall like rocks is no reason to include them in less expensive segments.

Besides that the 335i is better in every way from my point of view. Better brakes, ride quality, quieter, handles as well(I have the spt pkg), more comfortable seats that hold you better as well, nicer interior quality and much more power, expecially down low in the rev range.  The 98 M3 sedan was the ultimate ELLPS in it's time and for quite a few years after, but others have now surpassed it."
3192,tpjcourtney,February 2007,"Just a quick question about the list at the top of the page.  Why are the IS250 and 350 listed seperately while the A4, 3 series and C class are listed just once?  Not really important, just wondering."
3193,robbieg,February 2007,"Just my two cents. Most people cross shop vehicles based on price and people buy cars based on payments. I find it hard to believe that someone is looking at a base CTS and a 335. There is just too much of a difference in price and monthly payments. Thus, while they are both ELLPS they are not competitors.  Also, MSRP is accurate for the Japanese but is not accurate for Americans. The ELLPS segement should be defined based on model, not price. Lastly, at least we are no longer arguing about the MKZ."
3194,circlew,February 2007,"After driving a BMW, a CTS is the farthest thing from even a test drive, IMO.  We can discuss it here for it is the best the US has to offer at this point. The name will probably change soon anyway.  Regards, OW"
3195,qbrozen,February 2007,"of course i agree that many cars can be bought for less than msrp, but the reason why i am so adamant that msrp be the only measure when setting up the parameters of a discussion is because, as i posted here long ago, you are asking for trouble when you use anything else. You could have a vehicle thrust into the discussion based on anecdotal evidence of a one in a million deal. And what happens when a car fits the price cap one month due to a special rebate and employee pricing but then goes back to being too expensive the next month? MSRP is the most consistent and reliable measuring stick we have.  And as far as being defined by model, that is a topic we have covered before as well. If it were purely on model, then the TL and S60 would be excluded because they are not the entry-level models of their manufacturers."

3197,frisconick,February 2007,Would you say the entry level for acura would be the TSX ? :surprise:
3198,blueguydotcom,February 2007,"I consider both the TSX and TL entry lux cars. Acura/Honda doesn't have what it takes to compete beyond that realm. For some reason they're afraid to offer a mid-size or full size luxury competitor. Then again, they also refuse to offer RWD. Weird."
3199,habitat1,February 2007,"""Then again, they also refuse to offer RWD.""  Except, of course in the case of the S2000. It is a conundrum that Honda has produced a $33k limited edition sports car that matches the $50k Boxster and, IMO, crushes the Z4 and SLK in driving dynamics and performance, but has left their mainstream Acuras struggling to compete in the ELLPS market with FWD and the LPS market with AWD and an anemic V6.  I still think my 2004 TL 6-speed at $32k was a nice balance of luxury and performance compared to the 2004 crop of competitors. But now one would need to spend $38k+ for a TL-S to get a manual transmission, no more luxury and slightly more horsepower driving the wrong wheels. The 2007 TL-S is less competitive, IMO than the former 2004 TL 6-speed, relative to its price, performance, value positioning. If I had to do it all over today, I'd likely be on a plane to Germany doing the ED thing."
3200,blueguydotcom,February 2007,"I find the same pleasure in the corners. Any idiot can take his car to 80-90-100. But in most of the car they're driving, they simply can't corner.

The normal bias tapes were made of ferric oxide and the high bias tapes were made of chromium dioxide and later, metal (Type IV) was introduced.  The first cassettes that were considered hi-fi were the CRO2 tapes when used with Dolby B noise reduction.  I bought my first hi-fi cassette deck in the mid-80's. It was a Denon DRM-44HX. I used ""metal"" tapes and Dolby C with ""headroom extension (HX). The deck had an internal computer to custom tune the bias to the particular tape by recording and analyzing test tones on the tape (this was more accurate than pushing a button to select ""normal"" or ""high"" bias.  This is pretty much as far as the compact cassette format evolved. At the time, CD's I recorded onto metal cassette using all the bells and whistles were indistinguishable from the original CD source. That's how I remember it anyways.  Thanks for the memory tayl0rd.

Obviously she's driven my 06 330i. She finds it fun but not to her liking (I really wouldn't want two of the same car in the family anyway).  So we stopped by VW and she drove a GTI 4 door. Not a ELLPS, i know. But it leads into her reactions to the next two cars:  Acura TSX Acura TL  We got out of the TSX and I already knew she didn't dig it. When pressed by the car guy she matter-of-factly said, ""That car is soooooo slow.""  The dealer was actually pretty smart as he didn't flinch but said, ""Well try this TL Type S. It's got some power."" She agreed; I knew what her reaction would be but figured it would be amusing anyway. We got onto the road and he asked her, ""So how does it feel?""  ""Heavy and huge,"" came her immediate response. She's never heard me mention the TL ever.  We returned to the lot and he suggested an Accord V6. She has already been in them an answered instantly: no, old lady car.  Sigh, I think she may be driving her backup car for sometime as we've ruled out all SUVs, the Acura/Honda lineup, BMW and MB. Honestly, I didn't think she'd find the TSX that slow but after driving the GTI, she couldn't understand why anyone would opt for the far less responsive engine in the TSX.  Next stop Audi."

I drove the G35x two days ago and I had a completely different opinion from yours.  I feel the cars handles incredibly well, and rivals (comes very close) to the feel of a 3-series. There was also no front end dive when slamming on the brakes, and no heavy plowing in corners like the TL.  Good luck finding a final decision."
3230,plekto,February 2007,"You could always go with a roadster, you know... :P  The sad fast is that anything FWD will feel sluggish and dead compared to a RWD setup, because the steering is by definition going to have torque and weight on it bogging it down.  And 3500+lbs kills anything right there as well - it starts to feel like a GM or Ford in that it's good in a straight line, but lacks the tossability of say, an old BMW 2002 which is probably the best example of a sports sedan ever made - pure and simple and a blast to drive.  But two cars she should try are:  The older IS300. I has a great balance of power versus weight, compared to the too-slow IS250 and the silly priced IS350. It's the ONLY Japanese car I ever drove that felt like a European one. But then they de-powered the base model and made both cars so much more heavy... Ack.  The other is a RX-8. With leather, it's not too bad as far as feeling a bit luxurious. But it's light, quick, and fast. It feels a lot like well... like you took a G35 and dropped 500 pounds of dead-weight. Because the RX-8 weighs 3000lbs, yeah, it kind of IS exactly like that.  Plus, if she likes stick, it's even better.  IMO, the RX-8 handles better than even a 3 series. Herehsy I know, but the thing is that it's roughly 300lbs lighter and HP isn't everything. I'd take one over the 328i anyday. (the 335i is definately better, but dang what a pricetag) The IS350, at nearly 3600lbs is... well, yeah... It bludgeons its way through corners like a 5 series or Mercedes.

Same HP(230 vs 232). Of note is how the rear seats are very close in size to each other. If BMW thinks you can actually fit a 5th person in the center rear seat...  http://www.edmunds.com/new/2007/infiniti/g35/100822701/specs.html Yes, it is almost 500 lbs heavier.

A3 is one of the few small near lux cars with power, nice interior space and decent roadfeel/handling.  The RX-8 has great handling/good power but it's got no interior space - especially for a baby seat. Same interior problems with the IS. Evo is an economy car and feels it. Same with the WRX.  Really if the A3 gets shot down she's gotta re-examine her priorities. She's going to have to give up something: power, handling, space, small size, luxury. hopefulyl she'll pick luxury as then that opens the Mazda3 to us.  FWIW, those RDXs look pretty nice,"

The interior space is virtually identical to the 3 series.  I'd let her drive it. But, if she needs more space than a 3 series, she's looking at midsize cars. There's no way she's coming out ahead in that case. (ie - might as well try to fit a child seat in a smaller car than suffer with a boat)  There is another option, though... The IS300 Sportcross. This is a wagon version of the IS, and as such, has more rear room(though it's exactly the same, it FEELS larger - like the Volvo 240s did, for instance). It also could be had with stickshift, making it a solid performer.  Me? Unless you have a baby now, the reality is that a booster seat or even most full-size baby seats will fit in the rear of a RX-8. Shoot, I fit a full-size one in a Focus(rear pasenger seat), though there was only about 1 inch if clearance."

There is another option, though... The IS300 Sportcross.  1. Used - will only by new unless it's wholly unavoidable. 2. Far more cramped than an e46 and e90 - I couldn't sit in the back of an IS300. 3. Drives like a slothful wagon - zero power.  I've been in the RX-8 and it's cramped in the front and impossible for me to get in back (flipside I've ridden comfortably in the back of the e46/e90). Getting a car seat in the back of one would be evil and turn the car into a 3 passenger.  KD, I know the RDX's engine sucks gas. Nice small package though.

She wants midsize space and subcompact handling. Not going to happen without a huge gimmie somewhere, and the child seat seems like an obvious first place to start. Afterall, the difference between the rear passenger and rear center isn't that much in terms of safety, and there are dozens of makes of child seats.  And, yes, the RX-8 can fit a child seat in the rear. The seats are very low. I felt as comportable in the rear as most compact cars in the front. Think of it as a car with 4 bucket seats.  As for the space, it's like the Porsche 928. 2+2, so the rear takes a hit on paper because there's no center at all - it's all one big driveshaft tunnel and center console(which is awesome to use as a passenger, btw). I'd venture it loses about 15-20 cubic ft right there. But since most small cars don't USE that center rear area in actual use(child seat aside, which makes the rear good for NOBODY ELSE), it's like you took the 15 cubic ft of the least useable space in the car and got rid of it.  When I get in the rear seat of a car, I sit behind the passenger if possible, THEN on the driver's side. Middle is only if I have no choice at all.  It's small, but look at what his wife wants. She wants a 3 series but with a Minivan's cargo space by the sound of it.  If she goes small, the truth is that the rear will BE small - but since only small kids will go back there, it's not a huge deal, is it? I'd concentrate on trying any and all cars first - actually drive them all, then worry about if a seat can be wedged in the rear or not."

3241,plekto,February 2007,"The A3 is a nice little car, to be sure, but four things stick out in my mind.  1: It's essentially as reliable as a VW. Expect electrical nightmares. The Mini wins here, hands-down. That list right above this post of quality - VW/Audi is way way down the list - near the very bottom.  2:Audi can't seem to make a reliable transmission, either. The Mini is ahead a bit for the automatic, but the manual is words better.(don't know if she likes stick or not)  3:Depreciation is a killer on it. The Mini has virtually none - maybe $1000 a year. This is huge for me, personally, and why it's on my top 5 list.  4:The A3 has no real flair. It's very nice, but it's just not ""fun"" like the Mini is, IMO.  But if she's happy... wht are you going to do?  Though if she can wait... Check out the Volvo 3 series. It looks to be a better version of the A3 IMO. Maybe not as sporty, but definately safer and more reliable. The 220HP T5 looks to be an absolute screamer.  The BMW 1 series also is coming soon and it's well... it's a BMW. Expect amazing handling.  My gut says to buy the Mini and sell it in a year or two when the 1 Series comes out for a couple of thousand dollars less than your paid for it. That's cheaper than a lease on a Kia."
3242,blueguydotcom,February 2007,"It's essentially as reliable as a VW. Expect electrical nightmares.  We've both owned VWs and as i've owned BMWs too, I know that neither company makes good or reliable cars. Both my BMWs have exhibited electrical problems. Really, really poorly made cars, IMHO.  2:Audi can't seem to make a reliable transmission, either. The Mini is ahead a bit for the automatic, but the manual is words better.(don't know if she likes stick or not)  Audi/VW DSG is leagues beyond the 6 speed automatic in the Mini and all BMWs.  :Depreciation is a killer on it. The Mini has virtually none - maybe $1000 a year. This is huge for me, personally, and why it's on my top 5 list.  We plan to hold for 5-7 years and thus resale is of zero importance. Additionally, my check of used A3s within 200 miles only revealed 9 cars. The car isn't exactly getting tossed aside by owners. Vortex forums seems to reveal mostly happy A3 owners.  4:The A3 has no real flair. It's very nice, but it's just not ""fun"" like the Mini is, IMO.  Mini looks aggressive but to each his own. For a family but also people who want small and powerful, the Mini can't cut it. The A3 offers exactly what she wanted - power, luxury, small size, good interior space.  But if she's happy... wht are you going to do?  Make sure she's happy. That's my number 1 goal and the reason I would have said sure to the Mini if she wanted it. I didn't find it practical but having grown up with a mom who always owned sports cars, I know it's possible to get by with any car.  Check out the Volvo 3 series. It looks to be a better version of the A3 IMO.  Ehh. Just sold a Volvo S80 - worst car either of us have ever been near. I would sooner own a GM than a Volvo.  The BMW 1 series also is coming soon and it's well... it's a BMW. Expect amazing handling.  I've been around tons of 1 series cars (in europe and also we see them at our malls constantly - Mexico is around the corner) and they have a cramped, tiny, poorly conceived interior.  My gut says to buy the Mini and sell it in a year or two when the 1 Series comes out for a couple of thousand dollars less than your paid for it. That's cheaper than a lease on a Kia.  AFAIK, BMW will not release the 1 series 5 door hatch here. The coupe and convertible will be here in 08, supposedly: probably called a 2.  Trust me, we're not keen on Audi but for what she wants the options are limited. She liked it the most and for that reason, I will accept her decision."

If that's the case, then why aren't we all driving Toyota Camrys and Ford F-series pick-ups, since quality is ""moot"" compared to overall sales? :confuse:  Right...  Sales mean nothing to a semi-intelligent consumer looking for their next car. What does (not necessarily in this order) is quality, fun-to-drive, features, price, resale, gas mileage, etc... IMO, I couldn't care any less about the ""sales leader"" in any segment if it's not fun-to-drive, and doesn't offer the features I want, at a competitive price.  You may be surprised, but there are potential ELLPS buyers out there that just might care about quality. Maybe just a little, but they're out there. To them, BMW could sell a billion cars a year, but they still won't touch them if they're at the bottom of quality and reliability lists.

Sure it won't be a fast or probably won't handle as well as the BMW 335i but those marginal performance gains of the 335i only tell one story of the total picture. The 08' CTS will walk all over the BMW 5 series as plekto, has pointed out in features, price, and performance. The 08' CTS, also due to it's larger size will accomidate a family of 4 better than the IS350 or BMW 3 series. I think many ELLPS buyers shopping for a ELLPS will give the 08' CTS enough respect to add it to their list of cars. It is projected to sell in the neighborhood of 70,000 units. With a Coupe/Convertible and Wagon coming in a few year this car will easily sell over 100K units in just a few short years and have BMW 3 series type success which is currently the benchmark.

3267,cdnpinhead,March 2007,". . . solid engineering and long-term refinement.  This, I think, is the crux of the discussion, particularly where North American competition (to the BMW) is concerned. I bought into the Lincoln LS hype back in '99 & ended up with the first manual-transmission-equipped Lincoln in 50 years or so. I'm guessing it'll be at least that long until there's another one. I was so looking forward to replacing my V6 manual LS (the manual was only available with the 6) with a V8 manual, along with other tweaks that result from several years of production & feedback from the field -- I figured by the time I was ready to unload my car a much superior version would be available. What I got instead was the cancellation of the manual altogether, and the LS itself not long after. This is a car with an aluminum hood & front fenders, as well as suspension parts, anti-dive suspension, ventilated rear discs (ten consecutive stops from high speed with no fade) & a number of other things that caught my fancy & convinced me Lincoln/Ford was serious about the car. Oh well.  Anyway, refinement, incremental improvement & fixing what breaks is what makes a superior product -- not throwing the whole damn thing out every five years or so and starting over. I still enjoy my LS, but would never buy another American car in this class, even though the CTS does have merit. Fool me once. . .

Or, somehow, has the rumor and speculation about the new CTS allowed it to join the LPS class before it is even reviewed?  If we're going to talk about wheelbase, cubic this thats and the other thing, why isn't there mention of similarly sized cars from Hyundai? That spanky top o' the line model is, after all, comparable to a BMW 7 (in size). It says so in all the adverts. :confuse:  Spent wheel time again this weekend in a 2007 Chrysler 300 AWD ""Limited."" Lovely car, great MSRP, considering it has ""a lot"" if not almost all the amenities that come in the ELLPS and/or LPS class.  Yet I get out of a 2007 300 with 1,000 miles on the OD into a 2005 Audi A6 with 30,000+ miles on it, and the Audi feels newer, tighter, more controlled, refined, smooth, etc. The 300 seems somehow looser, not quite as precise in its steering, a little bit unrefined and floaty at speeds over 65. But with a nice long wheelbase, good leather, a decent stereo with Sirius Radio, and power pedals even -- what a lot of car for the money. Heck it has ESP and some fine Mercedes underwear. Upgraded 18"" wheels and tires round out the package as do easily modulated and smooth four corner disk brakes.  For the money, apparently, nothing even comes close -- but for pity's sake, it isn't in the same class as the other LPS cars (or even some of these ELLPS cars.)  The current CTS (also a car that I've driven extensively) is very competent and nearly as tight as the ""real"" LPS cars. But, to keep comparing cars based soley on wheelbase or 0-60 times or cubic hectares per fortnight seems (to me) to miss the point.  Shipo, the question stands, did the 5 series somehow fall from grace? Could the new CTS, not even out yet, already be the newest LPS? :confuse:"

3280,1487,March 2007,"""The problem with the CTS is that it will never be as communicative and responsive to the likes of the BMW and Audi because it is not engineered to do so.""  Audi? Surely you jest. The CTS has a nearly 50/50 weight distribution and RWD layout which you wont find in any Audi. I've never heard anyone suggest that the STS and CTS were lacking when compared to Audis. The CTS was developed to compete with German cars and much of its development happened in Germany. I dont know where you are getting your info about CTS development. The CTS was the first of many GM models to get extensive time at the Ring during development.  The CTS is larger and heavier than the 3 series and thus isnt likely to be as nimble. I don't know that its lacking compared to the 5 series though. Many seem to feel the curretn 5 is somewhat less connected than the last gen model, especially with the silly active steering.  ""Have you ever driven one of these BMW babies for any length of time?? This car is like putting on a set of wheels, chassis and engine and hooking it to your brain. The best is when you drive something else and you are at a loss!! ""  I have driven the last gen 540, 328, 330, X5 and the current 530. Again, away from a racetrack I would be hard pressed to find any definitive advtantage. The steering is heavy and precise, but that applied the old Cadillac Catera I drove as well. Sorry, but the qualities that exist in BMWs can be had in other cars.  I have driven the CTS as well. There are very few RWD american cars but the STS and CTS are definitely capable. I wouldnt try to compare FWD american family sedans to BMWs with RWD that cost thousands more."
3281,1487,March 2007,"""Staying out of the 5/CTS comparo mostly, I can say that Caddy hasn't yet proved they can do a world class interior, so I'll be very, very surprised if the '08 will turn my head in that regard.""  Pics of the CTS interior are widely available on the net, including here at edmunds. why dont you look at the pics before saying you wont be impressed. And yes, people have been inside the car and verified the materials are top notch. I have to wonder how any car enthusiasts has missed the positive reaction to the CTS. As for Caddy interiors: check the '08 CTS, DTS, Escalade, XLR, and '07 SRX before stating Caddy cant design a nice interior. The CTS is the only bad interior in the bunch.  I wouldnt equate Art and Science to the gangster-mobile 300 styling at all. Just because they both use large grilles doesnt mean they have anything in common. I dont see anything over the top about the STS (many feel its too conservative), SRX, DTS or XLR. the '08 CTS is many things, but ""cartoonish"" isnt one of them. The general consensus is that the car looks very good. Even the design critic at Automobile who hates most everything he reviews was gushing over the car. If you think the CTS is ugly I do wonder what luxury cars you find attractive.  I dont equate bland with attractive but you seem to be critical of Caddy designs because they are bold and stand out. would you prefer if Caddy when the lexus route and copied German designs?"

3283,wale_bate1,March 2007,"Caddy's styling has worked for them, as I said. It doesn't work for me. Hard edges and straight lines don't do much for me; I prefer a good deal more flow to my automotive shapes.  As far as copying goes, I think Toyota picked up surface cues from BMW, but the main bulk of the current styling genre seems to have borrowed more from other Japanese, who were copying Germans, but got it by way of an impaired Italian translator.  Of all in the entrylux and beyond classes, I think Audi has the best eye to real exterior design, and that's even with the absurd nose. Certainly I find their interiors to be the benchmark for which to aim. To the point, clean and well-executed."
3284,habitat1,March 2007,"""Sorry, but there is no subsantive reason to pay $10k more for a German luxury car vs a Cadillac or Lexus. German automakers have convinced Americans that their vehicles are worth a hefty premium over other luxury cars when there is nothing to back up this premium in terms of warranty, dealer service, reliability, performance, etc.""  First, don't even think about putting Cadillac and Lexus in the same sentence as if they have something in common vs. German cars. Nice attempt at association, but that's like me saying my golf game has more in common with Tiger Woods' than Phil Mickelson's because I'm right handed.  Second, there is no ""substantive"" reason in the world that anyone should pay any more than $25,000 for a CTS. My 2004 Acura TL 6-speed cost $32,400 new and is now worth (30,000 miles), according to Edmunds, $24,600 on trade-in value. That's a total of $7,700 in depreciation. A 2004 CTS with 30,000 miles is worth a measily $18,300 in trade in value and had an MSRP of over $40,000 (without many features the TL had as standard equipment). If you add $7,700 in depreciation to the value of a CTS, a new one should have cost $25,000 to be fairly priced against a TL. And that's assuming one can get past the butt ugly looks. :confuse:  The reason Cadillacs aren't worth crap as 3-4+ year old used cars is .... well they really aren't worth a whole lot more than that new. It's just that some poor people actually think that by going cheap up front, they are saving money. My 12 year old Nissan Maxima with 155k miles is worth more than most GM's, including Cadillacs, that are half it's age with half the mileage. And it looks and runs better.  Forget a BMW 3 series or 5 series, a three year old CTS with 30,000 mile would have actually cost you as much or more in depreciation than a Porsche 911S with MSRP of well over twice as much. Doesn't necessarily make me feel less guilty driving my 911S, just a boatload smarter."
3285,hauss,March 2007,"A little research on AutoTrader.com on used vehicles shows me that 75% of 3 series sedans being sold that are 2004 or newer have automatics. Even Bimmer drivers mostly opt for the auto. True, the IS should offer a stick but then again most drivers wouldn't choose it anyway."
3286,circlew,March 2007,"I have driven the last gen 540, 328, 330, X5 and the current 530. Again, away from a racetrack I would be hard pressed to find any definitive advantage. The steering is heavy and precise, but that applied the old Cadillac Catera I drove as well. Sorry, but the qualities that exist in BMWs can be had in other cars.  I guess you aren't a real driving enthusiast since you really can not tell the difference. Don't get me wrong. I respect all of your view points. To each his own.  However, the entire CTS package doesn't even come close to urging me to test drive the car, let alone for many, many miles.  Regards, OW"
3287,allargon,March 2007,"Those resale generalizations are true for most American cars--even most of the Cadillac sedans. However, the CTS doesn't have that horrible a resale--especially for an American car. BMW's have good residuals. However, ask anyone that BOUGHT a 330i how much of a depreciation hit they took. The 3 Japanese cars definitely win the resale side.  Looks are subjective. Fun factor (also subjective)--the BMW wins. I've actually driven most of the cars in this segment. That LARGER CTS is more fun to drive than the smaller Lexus IS 350. Service? The best service is a car that only has to go in for routine maintenance. The sales guy at my local BMW *bragged* about the number of loaner cars they had available. That didn't inspire confidence in the reliability of the car. Your mechanic friend is stuck in the past.  OW, IMHO, you should at least test drive the CTS, the A4, the 3 series, the new C class (no one is talking about that redesign), the G35, etc. As much I love the exterior looks of the CTS, I would consider myself an incomplete shopper if I didn't at least test the G35, the TL, the IS, the 3 series, etc.  I guess we do a new car around this time every year. Last year it was the IS vs. the 3 series. Now it's the not even released CTS. Hehe..."

3289,shipo,March 2007,"First off, let&#146;s lose the bilge water about what auto rags have written. They far too often stack the deck one way or another for their opinions to really mean much as a general statement.  &#147;Its not about CTS apologists. Its about you disregarding a lot of evidence that the CTS is a decent RWD sports sedan because you personally dont like it. Sorry, but you should take up your beef with the auto writers whos said the car was a legit contender to the 5 series when it came out in 2002. Nothing you say can prove the CTS is an also ran sports sedan so lets just agree that you dont like the car and could care less about its merits.&#148;  A decent RWD sports sedan? Like I said earlier, compared to an Accord, maybe so, compared to a 3-Series or a 5-Series, not happening. As for my not personally liking the CTS, uhhh, well, after driving it, it wasn&#146;t hard. FWIW, shortly after I bought my 2002 530i 5-Speed, I took a drive in a CTS. I have no idea who or what opined that the CTS was a legit contender, but I have to question its motives. Those two cars were as different as night and day and there is no way the CTS of that era was even qualified to sniff the fumes of the 530i.  You keep equating my critical opinions of the CTS because I don&#146;t like it. The point you&#146;re missing is that I didn&#146;t initially like it because besides being ugly inside and out, the early version of the CTS that I drove was a poorly executed, noisy rattle trap that had sloppy handling, an anemic engine, crappy ergonomics and uncomfortable seats. Yeah, I didn&#146;t like it, and for good reason too.  &#148;You are saying the the IS was way too small but the 3 series was spacious? OK, thats the first I've heard of that.&#148;  Obviously you have yet to take a look yourself. IIRC, bluebuydotcom posted a picture of his legs first inside of an IS and then inside of an E90. Those pictures illustrated what my kids found out very well. In this case, even the paper specs agree. Don&#146;t believe me? Look it up.  &#148;You say you value manual trannies and the CTS has one but you are trashing the CTS. Interesting.&#148;  You&#146;re pretty funny. The first couple of times I went into a Cadillac dealership to drive a manual CTS I had the sales person actually tell me that I didn&#146;t really want to drive a manual. When pressed, I was told by the salesman from both dealerships that not only did they not have any manual CTSs in stock, they&#146;ve never even had one in and never would. At that point I had nothing left to lose, so I asked about ordering one. Once again, in both cases the dealerships refused to even consider the option, &#147;We won&#146;t order one because we know that you don&#146;t really want a manual transmission and that in the end, you&#146;ll stick us with the car and demand an Automatic version instead.&#148;  FWIW, just about a year ago I did manage to happen upon a dealership that had a 6-Speed in stock and they were only too happy to let me drive it, I suppose the figured they&#146;d finally found a sucker to unload it on, anyway, it drove okay, and while the transmission was smoother and easier to shift than the one in my 1970 Challenger, it was still stiff and clunky compared to the tranny in the E60. That said, I believe that both transmissions are made by Getrag, so I&#146;m at a loss to explain the difference. Shifter maybe?  Other thoughts on last years&#146; drive of the CTS; the interior looked about as horrid as the early cars that I drove, however, at least it was screwed together better and had much better fit. The engine had also been dramatically improved over the early models, so much so that I&#146;d even go so far as to say that it was competent. Not as smooth as an I6, but then no V6 is so no loss there. That said, the car&#146;s suspension was still sloppy, the seats were still uncomfortable, and the ergonomics still weren&#146;t ergonomic.  &#148;Most people like the new CTS interior. Do you read any online or print car mags?&#148;  Ummm, do you rely on the car magazine for all of your opinions? I mean really, who gives a crap what a car magazine says?  &#148;I am merely agreeing with what many respected experts have said after seeing the car at the NAIAS.&#148;  No, I think that you&#146;re parroting the scribes who regurgitate the marketing bilge fed to them by the auto companies.  &#148;You are the first anti domestic guy (and there are thousands here on Edmunds) to say with a straight face (i assume) that the new CTS is ugly and you arent impressed in any way.&#148;  Me? Anti domestic? Hmmm, well, we currently have two domestic cars in our garage, and my wife is considering upgrading her daily driver with yet another domestic. A car by the way, pointed out to her by me. Also, I&#146;m actually proud to admit that I like the 300, go figure.  &#148;Wow. I guess if Bangle had designed it you would have been on board though.&#148;  Clearly you&#146;re either new around here or you haven&#146;t been paying attention. I was and still am one of the first and loudest critics of the bangalized cars. I like the looks of say the E60 better than say the CTS or the Aztek, but that ain&#146;t sayin&#146; much.  Oh, and FWIW, the same day I drove the CTS 6-Speed last year, I drove an A3 2.0T 6-Speed. Yikes, what a difference. Even though I&#146;m not even remotely a fan of FWD cars, I&#146;d take a FWD A3 over the CTS in a heartbeat.  Best Regards, Shipo"

I'm a self-professed manual transmission bigot and have never made a secret of that fact; however, given your choices of two unpalatable options, I'd have to take a pass until I was able to get something I liked. If either of those two cars were given to me, I'd immediately turn around and sell them as I have no desire to drive either.

3295,louiswei,March 2007,"Hi guys, was away for 2 weeks and wow, this place is busier than ever. However, I see that the topics being discussed here haven't changed much...  After taking a week to read all the posts, a thought has surfaced in my mind and I thought I'd share it with you guys. I think generally speaking we can break the ELLPS buyers into 2 groups:  Group 1: Those whom are looking for a pure performance car which also can serve as a daily driver. People in this group tended to opt for manual tranny, sports package but usually not so hot on the luxury items.  Group 2: Those whom are looking for a car that's A LITTLE sportier, A LITTLE faster, A LITTLE more luxurious and A LITTLE better looking (subjective I know) than the regular midsize 4-door sedans. People in this group tended to opt for auto tranny and usually won't push their cars to the limit nor track their cars.  I personally think it's silly to count any worthy candidate out of contention because of reasons such as lack of auto tranny, FWD and softer ride than the benchmark (3-series). The reason why this segment is booming is because now-a-day there are so many different choices in the market so almost everybody out there could find one for his/her liking.  Ah, it's good to be back..."

3301,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"Sir, may I suggest a subscription to CR?  That's amusing. CR's reviews are akin to what my mother-in-law would write.  The A3 weighs as much (V6 AWD) as a CTS yet has a 101"" wheelbase and your telling me it drives better than the CTS?  v6? AWD? I'm talking 2.0T, starting at 25k, not that warthog AWD model with the 3.2. 2.0T with manual is around 3200 lbs. That's a significantly smaller, lighter, more responsive car.  You're comparing a tight tiny compact wagon to a roomy full size entry level lux sedan?  Both are considered entry level lux. What you call ""roomy"" I call yacht-like. I have no need for a car's with a cavernous interior and extreme exterior dimensions. My e90 is far too big inside and out for what I want from a 4 door vehicle.  BTW, a loaded A3 Quattro can top $40k. Is that not overpriced?  It is. But then again, the A3 I found entertaining was priced less than 30k msrp. The last CTS I drove had a sticker nearing 40k. That's 4k more than my e90 330i. :O  I wish I knew which CTS you were driving that drove like a ""plow"". Did you puncture the shock before getting behind the wheel?  Manual CTS loaded up with the sport package. The salesguy laughed when I said I wanted to drive a manual. He insisted nobody buys manuals and especially not a Caddy with a manual. He was convinced caddy = class and sophistication. Quite good for a laugh."
3302,chavis10,March 2007,"1. Not excuses, they are facts. Wheelbase length directly affects how ""nimble"" the car feels 2. This is America. We put emphasis on size/practicality. Some people might actually find it hard to justify spending $40k on a car who's back seat they cannot fit in. 3. Now your response can be classified as an excuse. As long as GM is getting dogged by the mags, it's a matter of fact. When things start to turn around, the mags aren't digging deep enough. Hmm, pot. kettle. black. 4. Did this same critic bother to focus the microscope on any other brand? It's easy to point to GM who is actually trying to compete unlike Ford/Chrysler who just folded under pressure. Despite the growing pains of their first effort (sigma) they are following up with an improved platform and a newer branch off (Zeta). Lincoln abandoned their LS platform. 5. I do not find where the CTS has been poorly put together. Exaggeration does not count as fact around these parts. I can't believe you could honestly use the word overpriced referencing any non-BMW model. If anything, BMW has allowed the price in this class to rise to these ridiculous levels. 6. The CTS' dash, while industrial looking is actually soft to the touch (grained portion). Lutz and GM have acknowledged spending big money on dashes that looked cheap. Now, they've come back with a nicer looking dash than probably cost less money to make. Is the CTS less ergonomic than an A4's tiny button array with no ""off"" button for the A/C? Was it's high centrally placed nav system less user friendly than the C's COMAND, iDrive or Audi's interface which placed the jog control on the right side of the screen furthest away from the driver? These comments are utterly ridiculous and much like the auto writers you are blaming, it seems you haven't dug deep enough into the cars that in your mind are so superior.  Judging by the sales of the current CTS, you seem alone in your opinions. I doubt most people who buy cars in this class are even enthusiast. A 50 year old woman in my department wants a 325i not because of it's reputation as the ""ultimate driving machine."" She wants it because it's a BMW and she doesn't like MB's (no reasons cited, just a matter of taste). She drives very slow and uninspired. She wants the car as a status symbol and despite the fact that she said she wants a quiet smooth ride and a roomy back seat, she'll probably get the 325i when a ES350 would probably fit the bill."

3304,1487,March 2007,"I fail to see why you think the CTS is so large. Its a midsize car and is sized accordingly. The car is 191 inches long which is hardly ""yacht like"" in my book. The DTS is a yacht as is the S550 or A8 but not the CTS. It seems like you want a really small car and in that case the CTS isnt for you but many people want a usable backseat and an airy cabin. Anyone over 5' 10"" is likely to feel squeezed in a 3 series which you feel is too large.  ""Manual CTS loaded up with the sport package. The salesguy laughed when I said I wanted to drive a manual. He insisted nobody buys manuals and especially not a Caddy with a manual. He was convinced caddy = class and sophistication. Quite good for a laugh. ""  Most CTS models are sold with autos and this is the case for most vehicles which offer a choice of transmissions. I dont see how the dealer's attitude towards manulas is relevant to the conversation. If you wanted a CTS manual you could get one, thats the bottom line. Go to a Lexus dealer and look for a manual IS350 and see what reaction you get there. The majority of buyers in this segment want autos and thus most Caddy dealers are going to order auto equipped CTS'."
3305,1487,March 2007,"I thought you were saying ""Ring"" development didnt mean much and the IS was an example. If you own the IS than I assume you feel it handles well enough.  I disagree that development time at the Ring doenst mean much because I have yet to read about a product developed over there that hasn't handled well. GM had developed several vehicles over there and it seems to have paid off. I wouldn't use the CTS as an example of a vehicle that was developed over there and didn't benefit."

The way you're trying to blur lines in amusing. You're comparing a base A3 with no options for $25k with a loaded CTS for $40? How? Why? The A3 2.0T has NOTHING in common with a CTS. Less mass = lighter on the feet feeling, that's elementary. I mentioned the Quattro model simply because it's price would be the one thing in common with a CTS.  I don't know how you could call a base A3 entry level lux. It's Audi's version of a Mazda3 hatchback that can cost twice as much. There's nothing entry lux about a $25 car with a urethane steering wheel and no power seat controls. Gimme a break.  What options did the CTS have compared to your $35-36k 330? Options add money so you can't say it cost $4k more if it was equipped with $4k worth of options. It kills me when people compare a 3 series naked from the factory with a loaded up competitor and wanna talk price and value. BTW, Cadillac must serve a larger range of buyer with the CTS. They must serve people who like to drive as well as people who only want one because it's a cadillac. BMW markets their cars to enthusiasts only, which is fine. Poseurs who drive BMWs just because are the ones that have to put up with the firm ride, hard seats and 35 series run flat tires when all they wanted was a status symbol for a car."
3307,chavis10,March 2007,"I couldn't agree with you more. I remember when the original G35 came out, although it was fast and delivered good value, it wasn't refined enough and it's interior too cheap. Now that it's improved those areas, it's considered soft. If you aren't BMW in this class of vehicle, you can't win- PLAIN and simple. The IS350 currently has the best interior design and detail in the class in my opinion yet this is rarely mentioned. It's gauges and center stack run laps around the 3 series and so are all the other aesthetics yet this didn't matter because VDIM or whatever it's called couldn't be shut down (prior to '07 m.y.).

3316,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"bluedotguy, read up on CR a little more. If you do you'll find that their testing methods are the most sound from an experimentation standpoint than any other auto publisher.  I'm well aware of their propaganda.  You may not want to believe that because their reviews don't focus a great amount of time on the one component that other publishers do but it's true. If you want to argue this point then it just tells us you truly don't know their methods.  I know their methods, their claims of objectivity and I'm well aware of the mystique some provide them with - my father swears by them. That said, if I want to find out about a dryer or stovetop, I'll check their data. If want a car review...I'll go drive the car for myself.  Tell me, do you really let the review of someone on say R&T influence your decision? Will a grandma's review from CR push you away from an RX8 because the reviewer writes that the car rides rough?  Or are you talking about projected data related to reliability and such? Data some - like my father - take as gospel. I've personally owned two BMWs, a Mazda and a VW in the past 6 years. Of those 4 cars, only one was an exceptional car that never had a single problem: the Mazda. Does CR's data back that up or refute it? Don't know; don't care. I bought the other cars for fun and my next vehicle in 08 (unless God answer's my prayers and kills my e90 or gets it stolen in 07) will be purchased based more on emotion than data.  I can live with the highly rated toaster or the suggested grill but when it comes to cars - something I'm passionate about - I don't care about the reliability/IQS scores. It's a toy first, appliance second."

3318,hauss,March 2007,"I don't buy my cars based on the reviews of any publisher. My point was that as far as publishers go their data and test methods are the most reliable and are tied to the specific purpose of the vehicle. That's why some of their highest rated vehicles are sports cars. So, they don't always just base all comparisons around the Accord and Camry.  Oh, as for the reliability/IQS scores you should realize they are based on the likelihood you'll experience a problem. Simply stating a car is reliable does not mean it will never encounter problems. It merely means the ones rated highest have the least likelihood of experiencing problems. So, it's probable but not likely a car rated highly can have a lot of problems and likewise a car rated poorly can have none."

The press and reviews don't mean jack to me because they worship this little annoying car.  No one said a Mazda was as reliable, dependable, or as fuel economical as a Honda or Toyota.  However.. Mazda did used to have a solid 4/50 bumper to bumper and 5/60 powertrain warranty, so I'm sure you will benefit from that. It did strike me as a HUGE red flag when we shopped the 3 at the end of February and saw the good warranty was reduced!!!!

3328,andres3,March 2007,"I don't know what you people count as ""sport"" or ""luxury"" but any ""premium"" brand base model vehicle with no options is about the dumbest buy you can make.  First of all, I'm pretty sure most of the European profit is earned from the overpriced ""options"" you seem to love. Their base pricing is quite reasonable.  Secondly, calling a sport luxury base model ""optionless"" is wrong. For example, with a base A3 you still get:  17"" alloy rims and wheels. ESP, dual auto climate control system, Front and front side air bags, ABS, EBD and all the other acronyms VW and Audi make up. You get the same 2.0T engine, the same transmissions, the same body, the same paints, same suspension as premium model) the only real loss is the steering wheel (in my opinion).  To me, a luxury/sport car is one that has a good structure (chassis, frame, suspension, engine, transmission, wheels, interior quality, comfortable seats). Everything else is just an added ""feature."" Tons of features does not make a luxury car. My 03 Accord V6 had everything standard included (including your beloved 8 way power seat) but I didn't consider it more luxurious than my Audi."

Also, is it fair or logical to say Car A is crap because you admittedly dont like Car A because of where its made? Or is just better to say that Car A is not your cup of tea but is still a nice choice for others.  What part of the country do you inhabit (if you dont mind me asking)?"

This isn't you grandfather's Cadillac anymore.  Yeah - for loads less. Don't forget GM offers their credit card program/deal dollars and financing deals form time to time. So that $33-35K base CTS can be had for closer to what a $28-30K 3 series would run you.(0% or even 2.9% financing is huge - it can knock off the equivalent of 4-5K off the sales price)"

3333,dpalmer2,March 2007,Do you feel that any car with a luxury manufacturer's badge is a luxury car regardless of content? That seems a little odd because luxury brands seem to revel in the fact that they offer so much cutting edge technology and uneccesary luxury features. What good is a luxury car that has no more features than a Honda Civic? IMHO it should take more than a badge to have a luxury ride. Maybe thats just me though. Regular cars have so many features these days that I dont think there is much reason to pay premium dollars for a stripped luxury sedan.
3334,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pre-disposed to hating American cars the moment I get in one. Or just see them. My viewpoint obviously will influence my perception of the car. Can't be helped - I'm human and prone to emotional decisions about cars. You get into a GM vehicle and if you're blindfolded you can feel it. Ditto Mopar and Ford. End up with all of them traveling for work. They're consistent, I'll give them that much.  West Coast.

3337,fedlawman,March 2007,"I'm getting sick of all this CTS, M-B, BMW bashing. All this talk about the CTS and M-B C-Class is really splitting hairs. I think some people on the boards (myself included) are sometimes guilty of exaggerating their feelings a little for the sake of making a point. The point may be valid, but IMO, the gulf that separates these cars is not the chasm that some would have you believe.  Sure the CTS isn't as tight or nimble as the BMW, but it is still a fine entry-lux sport sedan. If you like the looks and the feel, and get a screaming deal at purchase, it can be a fine choice. The C-Class is another bird altogether. The M-B (with sport suspension) is right up there with the BMW in ride/handling dynamics, it has a bank vault rigid body structure, and it has a quiet, refined demeanor. Quality has been a problem, and some interior plastics are cheap, but perhaps the new C-Class addresses these issues.  The Lexus IS didn't live up to the pre-release claims of building a better 3-series - so what? Although, when driven side-by-side with the Bimmer, the Lexus lacks steering feel and handling response, taken on it's own merits, it's still a very competent sport sedan with the bonus of high quality materials and outstanding expected reliability.  The challenge manufacturers have in this most competetive segment is choosing who they want their buyer to be, and then making a car for them. Infiniti is a fine example. The previous generation G35 was a great handling, snorting stomping, fun-to-drive sport sedan. Unfortunately, Infiniti listened to the complaints about NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) and cheap interior quality, and they ""fixed"" those issues - at the expense of responsive handling and tight dynamics. IMO, Infiniti has turned the G35 into a Buick and ruined it.  Yeah, we have a tendency here to describe molehills as though they are mountains. Those of us with track experience (more of us here than you think) can feel and appreciate the undeniable edge that BMW's possess over their very fine competition, and we're not willing to sacrifice even a drop of performance in return for electro-luminescent instruments or perforated leather seats. Others here are looking for a different blend of luxury and sport and probably can't tell or don't care about the subtle differences in driving dynamics of any of the cars on this list.  Bottom line - none of these cars are pure sports cars. They are too heavy and possess too many compromises for the sake of refinement, luxury, styling, room, and price. The car you buy should be the car that possesses the balance of these traits that most appeals to you and fits your lifestyle."
3338,andres3,March 2007,"You sort of made my point. You can get tons of ""features"" and options on a Honda Civic (including a moonroof and all), but that doesn't make the Civic a luxury car.  You can get a Hyundai with so-called luxury amenities these days. To me, a luxury car isn't the nameplate, but is more about the driving experience. The sophisticated and refined suspensions and drivetrains, the interior comfort, ergonomics, and material quality. You can get leather in a Mazda, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of the leather in an Audi. Honda's leather also falls a league behind Audi's. A lot of cars have leather wrapped steering wheels now, but they don't compare to the feel I enjoy on the Audi leather wrapped steering wheel.  Should they include a few more items as STANDARD equipment? Probably they should. Xenon lights would be nice as standard. I can actually live without leather seats though.... I could use a 6 CD changer... that would be nice, my Honda had that. But no matter how much content you put into an economy car, it'll still never be luxury. Case in point: VW is regarded as having very nice interiors. The GTI or GLI Jetta do have a ""nice"" interior, but compared to the A3, falls about one league behind. A3 is luxury, GTI/GLI are nice (for an economy car)."

It's amazing that to some people, nothing is more important then the upper 2/10ths of driving excitement that can rarely be experienced in todays traffic. It's also amazing how some people regard cars whose foundation is that of an $15k economy car as luxurious. It's amazing how the A4 is considered ""superior"" than the CTS in this forum when it uses yesterday's technology in a FWD chassis which weighs 3700 lbs with an unusable back seat on a 104"" wheel base. I'm 5'11"" and couldn't sit behind myself in one, I tried.  What I hear are excuses as to why BMWs cost so much. I will never take way from their driving involvement (spt pck only). However, why do we have to pay so much and get so little else in terms of the rest of the car? What you guys are basically telling me is that you're paying EXTRA for the chassis and that's it. BMW would never get my money because that's nonsense and cheats the customer out of his/her money.  I agree with others here, the difference between these cars is very slim. So slim in fact that I would easily take one of the less expensive more practical cars any day over a 335i sedan. Acura TL and IS350 have far superior cockpits compared to the 3 series. New '08 C class/CTS have better looking far more inspired designs from what I have seen in pics. New G35 looks far more inviting and aesthetically pleasing. In my book, chassis tuning is only part and not whole. Those cars offer a larger percentage of the pie for less money.

They have a chart similar to Problems per vehicle, but instead use a more intelligible % less and % more than average reliability based on all cars from all models. So the median/average is 0% reliability. 50% would be 50% more reliable than the average vehicle. -50% would be 50% less reliable than the average vehicle.  SAAB and Cadillac have serious issues! Audi has done as they promised and brought reliability back to respectability and CR recommended (even the first year A3). Honda and Toyota are dominant. Subaru is truly performing at Japanese levels. Mazda, Suzuki, Nissan, & Mitsubishi lag behind. They noted that some Nissan models were good while others were terrible. The one's that were terrible were all built in the US however. VW still has poor reliability. Audi promised years ago to improve reliability and have done so, leaving VW in the dust. Mercedes has been negatively affected by Chrysler, and instead of Chrysler improving with the merger, MB has joined them in the pits."
3376,andres3,March 2007,"I agree... when you are driving, it really doesn't matter what the exterior looks like (except the hood) or what color it is (except the hood and side mirrors).  Therefore, I wouldn't go so far as to say I don't care about exterior looks, but I value interiors much more.  By the way, the A3 is not an econobox. It has advanced suspension systems and components. All you have to do is drive one to figure this out."
3377,circlew,March 2007,"I tend to keep the balance of everything when procuring a new vehicle. I also like to feel good when I look at it before I drive. It sets the stage for me.  For BMW, I really liked the 98-2006 E46 and from this board, learned it drove well also. To me, the change in '06 was ok on looks as opposed to the 5'er which I am still getting used to. The new 5's lines from the sketches look much more fluid IMO.  My favorite looking bimmer is the current 6 series.  So, I'm not as pure as others about the drive bent. That is why I perceive the CTS the way I do. No attraction.  Regards, OW"
3378,fedlawman,March 2007,"The $38,230 price I quoted for the Cadillac CTS turns out to be for the ""Sport"" model with 18"" wheels, sport suspension, and few other options.  The CTS that most closely compares to a base 328i with optional leather seating is the ""3.6L Standard"" model. With optional power moonroof (the BMW comes with one), the Caddy stickers for $34,630. The BMW without the seat heaters (this CTS doesn't come with them either) has an MSRP of $34,545.  Also for reference, MSRP's (rounded off) for some of the other ELLPS's:  Acura TL - $34,000; TL-S - $38,000 Lexus IS250 - $31,000; IS350 - $36,500 Infiniti G35 - $34,000 BMW 335i - $39,500 M-B C230 - $30,500; C350 - $39,000 Audi A4 2.0T - $30,000; 3.2 - $36,000  Here's my take on this class:  If you're shopping for an Auto Transmission equipped ELLPS, I think the G35 pretty much offers the best bang for the buck (HP, handling, luxury, quality, features, etc).  If you're shopping for an ELLPS with a Manual Transmission, things get more interesting. The G35 is out of contention because it's 6MT drivetrain just sucks. I'd then eliminate the IS250, M-B C230, and both Audi's because they either lack HP, weigh too much, or both. The Lexus IS350 and Acura TL don't come with an MT (too bad), so they're out.  That leaves the Acura TL-S, BMW 328i and 335i, the Cadillac CTS 3.6L, and the M-B C350 Sport.  #1. A bare-bones 328i for $33,000 is #1 on my list for it's best-in-class handling dynamics (it weighs 250 lbs less than the 335i!), solid straight-line performance (0-60 in 6 seconds flat), upscale cabin appointments, and outstanding value for the dollar.  #2. A tie between the 335i and Acura TL-S. The BMW offers RWD handling and more power, but the TL is less expensive and has more standard features. Both are outstanding sport/luxury sedans that offer a different blend of performance vs. luxury.  #3. I haven't driven the M-B C350, but I have driven the outstanding C230 Sport. Assuming the C350 offers similar driving dynamics but more power than it's little brother, I'm thinking that the C350 offers BMW 328i performance at a 335i price. Of course, who can put a price on the ""Mercedes feel"" - it is a nice piece.  #4. The Cadillac CTS needs evolution. It has good ride and handling, but the BMW and M-B are better. The 3.6L engine is smooth and sweet, but the CTS barely manages to reach 60 MPH in under 7 seconds. It's also ugly and cheap looking. I can't think of a single reason to choose the CTS over the less expensive BMW 328i. This is the oldest car on the list though, and the MY2008 CTS is looks promising."
3379,calhon,March 2007,"""They have a chart similar to Problems per vehicle, but instead use a more intelligible % less and % more than average reliability based on all cars from all models.""  It may seem more intelligible to you, but the reality is it hides vital information.  Is the average 2 or 10 problems/cars? If it's 2, the difference between average and 50% below average is merely 1 problem/car over a period of years. With an average of 10, you're looking at 5 problems/car -- an entirely different ball game.  So, which is it? What if the average is only 1 problem/car?"

Feel free to do the same to the 3er, IS350, G35 and TL if you have reasons, personal experiences, or facts to back it up.

Both cars my left knee rode the arm rest on the door. The cars were just too small.  I sat in the TL and felt like I wasn't trying to wear a pair of jeans from 5 years ago. The car performed nicely. Sure its FWD offers a different kind of feel to your drive, but weighed against the shoehorned-in feel of the 3 or G35 I couldn't pass on it.  And I so wanted the BMW."
3386,nkeen,March 2007,"I had a TL and moved to the 325i with ZSP. The TL was a comfortable car, while not on a par with a big Volvo, for instance. But it had its ergonomic nuisances -- a key fob that dangled in my knees relentlessly (why, oh why do the press all grumble about the starter button?), handbrake on the wrong side of the transmission tunnel, km readings on speedo impossible to read. The biggest problems that I have with the BMW are the narrowness of the sports seats at the base of my back, side bolsters that can sometimes feel as though they are jabbing into my ribs, and the tendency of the seat cushion to feel like a well after a long drive. On the other hand, the seat does a good job of holding me in place when I toss the car around. Also, I don't get the rotor ache in my right shoulder that the TL and other cars give me. It's not the fashion, but I do wish the US market E90 were available with cloth. I'm 50, 6'00"", 185lbs, and by no means perfectly proportioned (long torso, so headroom's a problem in many cars with sunroofs, but not in the Bimmer)."

The seat bolsters were too narrow for me to get my shoulders all the way back into the seatback. Also, I hated the seat controls being under my right quad. Now, all of this was in the first gen. But still what were they thinking with putting the controls there???

That doesn't mean squat in relation to the driving position. I drove the car, i know how it felt and it felt claustrophobic. The side of the door felt too close, my right arm seemed to continually bang on the center console, the steering wheel fat big, fat and intrusive. These are all feelings.  I've sat in the back of cars before that say they have exceptional leg room - like the current honda accord - yet because the seat is so low to the floor, they're far, far more uncomfortable for me than even an old Mrk IV Jetta - which had seemingly little legroom but because the seats were so high, one could sit bolt up right, knees cocked at 90 degrees. This is where tape measurements fail...they can't convey actually feeling something in person.

The backseat may be bigger. The front seat was insanely tight for me. What else is there to say? you have an opinion and I have one. I pretty much despised the 07 G35. The front seat space felt surprisingly similar and tight to the IS350. Regardless of dimensions quoted there's a feeling people get when they sit in a car. The G35 felt okay until I started to drive it and then it felt tight and claustrophobic.  That's not coming from the same person that thinks the 3 series has become too big, is it?  Again, what's your problem? Yes, the e90 is too big on the inside for me - do you get it's a personal preference? The lack of cockpit feel, the super wide front seat, the expanse from door to door makes the car feel very buick-like. The e46's interior was better for me. No other way to put it. Add to the fact that compared to the e46 the e90 is also heavier, longer, more isolated, has less roadfeel and overall feels like a barge, yeah, sorry if I'm not doing cartwheels over the car.  The G35 felt worse as I had the sensation of being squeezed by the dash, sides, etc. The car's banal power delivery, chatty-rough engine, heavy and numb steering and the total lack of flingability ruined the drive. It was not an edge of your seat fun car - it was more 5 series clone. And truth be told not too far off from my e90 - which I don't like either.  I've got a narrow range of what I find acceptable. Picky in the extreme about everything. I want it all - decent space, power, handling, lightweight, docile when requested, loud and brash when pushed. At this point, no car really achieves that. The e90 is close but the weight, isolation and size issue make the car impossible for me to enjoy. My ZHP was a car that fit me better - save for its lack of power; unfortunately, now there are only used ones available, and BMW builds such crappy cars there's little chance i'll take a used bimmer."

I suspect the G35's ""insanely tight"" front seat would probably not have bothered you in the least, had it been attached to an E36 M3. Or maybe it would have.  To be honest, I enjoy reading your posts more than most because I know you will never hold back on how you really feel. As in ""BMW builds such crappy cars"". But I also assume you are more than intelligent enough to know that such extremely worded comments are also more likely to elicit responses. For example, I have close enough to first hand experience (i.e within my extended family) to accurately claim that if BMW builds ""crappy cars"", than Audi is fully two notches below BMW on the feces scale.  Don't take my responses as anything more than a friendly volley back at you. You serve up a lot of aces that I agree with, but I'm still holding a racket, just to keep you honest."
3397,hauss,March 2007,"I'm talking about the sedan also. blueguydotcom, how can you find the G35 small inside when you drive a 330i? Your car is smaller. What was it about it that made it feel smaller to you?"
3398,hauss,March 2007,"hab, I've got to agree with blueguydotcom on the interior space of the G35...to an extent. I found the driver's seat to be a bit cramped too. Now I'll admit I didn't drive it but I've sat in it twice now (once in a show room and another time at an Auto Show). I felt like a lot of things were creeping up on me much like blueguydotcom felt. I wonder how it drives? Suppose I should test drive one someday for grins and giggles? Also, I know the numbers suggest the G35 has the most combined leg room but why does it seem that my TL is roomier? Maybe it's the little things like the design of the back of the front seats or something."

3400,joe131,March 2007,I see. So it is just the idea of metal and wood that you like better? You just want to be able to read on a specifications sheet that the wood and/or aluminum underneath the plastic surface is genuine? Ok. Gotcha.
3401,andres3,March 2007,"I love my Aluminum trim in the A3 on the vents. You can actually feel and touch the aluminum metal, not plastic. Go ahead and flick it, touch it, caress it, it's nothing like ""fake-aluminum."" I vote for real aluminum; plus, it's shinier."
3402,louiswei,March 2007,"Hey Joe, let's put it this way, if I am going to drop 40 big ones on a car I'll sleep better at night if I know the wood trim or carbon fiber trim on my car aren't fake. Metallic trim I can live with since it is just plastic and one can't really fake plastic but I much prefer aluminum over it."
3403,joe131,March 2007,I like stainless steel better myself. Maybe I can convince car makers to use it everywhere. Or maybe a plastic imitation of stainless steel. That would be ok too. That real metal just feels so bad when it is super hot or cold. Ouch!

3405,hauss,March 2007,"Haha! Very funny, but joe131, are you sure they coat aluminum trim with plastic? I think they may coat it with a silicate but that's not the same thing as straight up plastic. As for the difference between fake plastic wood trim and real wood trim highly polished just one look and you can tell. The fake stuff looks, well, eh, fake and the real stuff looks luxurious. Plus, when you tap your finger nail against it it puts off a nice little thump thump while the fake stuff goes tink tink. I'd rather the highly polished real wood trim thank you."

3408,joe131,March 2007,"Some aluminum may be anodized or treated with phosphate, but may then be more susceptible to fine scratches from keys, rings, shoe soles and the like.

But it was enough of a view to tell it's exponentially better than the current CTS interior and certainly capable of being as good as it looks in pix.

I've been spending a lot of time at Lexus dealerships lately too as I just put down a deposit on a GS350RWD for my fiance last night. I should have noticed it.  Anyway, when you're at the car show check out the carbon fiber trim (fake) on both the Vette Z06 and another high end car there whose make and model are elluding my memory. They're horrible. I'd say that Acura does fake carbon fiber trim better than any of 'em."
3415,gregg_vw,March 2007,"Your points about wood v. metal v. plastic are good ones. However, why buy wood furniture when you can have durable plastic furniture? Why buy leather shoes when there are breathable plastic models? Why do people pay more for anything, when a lesser substance can serve or suffice? Why does anyone ever buy a Rolex watch?  It comes down to personal preference, the market level in which you are shopping, and what consumers in various strata expect. You'd never expect plastic wood in a Rolls. If a car's competition all offer wood or metal, then plastic is probably not the way to go, regardless of its durability. The manufacturer who won't spend the extra few cents it takes to use real wood veneer may be pennywise and pound foolish.  Look at the awful fake wood that used to be in cars, at the same time when British and German interiors used real wood. It is true that the fake stuff has gotten so much better--and some of the real wood now is poorly done or cheaply executed, and doesn't look as good as some of the fake stuff.  The painted aluminum is the worst, because it eventually wears off in spots and looks as nasty as the old plastic chrome interior trim used to be. The real aluminum in my car scratches easily, but it doesn't look like anything but the metal that it is. I like that. Chacun a son gout."
3416,1487,March 2007,"Members of the press did get into the car in Detroit and were impressed. I read this on Autoblog and other sites where people had been in the car.

Of course they gave it 4/5 stars and said it was great anyway. I doubt that would've been the case if it wasnt a 3 series. Its just one more example that build and material quality have nothing to do with reliability. Automobile said this is the 4th long term BMW they have had engine problems with since 1994.  Many have said they will respect the CTS when is reaches the ""world class"" status of its foreign competitors but to me world class embodies a lot of things. None of these cars is perfect and while the CTS's interior design is quite odd I havent heard anything about CTS engine rebuilds at 20k miles. I guess it all depends on how one defines world class."

Those are basic things in a luxury car, with or without the P! Now, you have to upgrade the damn thing to get leather. WTF????? Here in Atlanta you can't throw a stone without hitting a 3 series. Be it one of the Banglelized versions or previous. And most of those are the base model and a good many of those are without the upgraded options that should be standard on a car of that cost. Even at the base model's cost. You cannot tell me most of those people are buying the car for feel. If we were to survey most of them I'm confident they'd mostly tell you they like the image and prestige of a BMW and think it looks cute!  I will give them credit for this though. They're improving their base model to include more and more options. But get with the program, BMW, and offer leather as standard. Leatherette is a joke. And do it without raising the cost. There's no reason for the leatherette."

Luxury some would say, while myself and others have ditched RFTs because of their weight and influence on handling. Personally, I would like a great deal of the sound deadening material removed from my car.  If I go BMW again I may opt for the ette as I was in an 07 with it and it felt fine.

Also, I think very few in the ELLPS market would consider leatherette a better choice to leather.  And just throwing this out there but if you're looking for more P than L in a car why not try something in a different category? I mean a Porsche's interior is pretty spartan compared to that of the average ELLPS. Might cost you a bunch more but then again you might be able to get a used one for a decent price. Then you'll get more go than show."
3425,louiswei,March 2007,"Got to agree with hauss here, a $39K car (MSRP, I don't want get into the Euro delivery discussion) without leather in today's auto market is PATHETIC. And BMW also charges another grand for metallic paint! WTF??!!. Hands down that the 3er is definitely the performance king in the ELLPS segment but regular Joes and Janes ain't gonna take notice of that comparing to others such as the IS and G. Let's be frank here, I know many regulars here are the true enthusiasts and value the P way above L. But I still think the majority buyers out there are more likely to be the regular Joe/Jane type and standard leather plus no cost for metallic paint would make them much happier.  Face it, most people buy BMW because its a BMW, not because it's the best performer in its segment. Also, most people buy the 3 not because its the best ELLPS out there but it's because they couldn't afford the 5."

Then you'll get more go than show.  Look over your paragraph for a second. We're in the Entry level luxury performance sedans forum. Does Porsche make a sedan? Nope. And FWIW, Porsche's interiors are great!  The market for performance sedans is exceptionally small. You want 4 doors, power, handling, at worst AWD and a manual.  Some might call the Evo and WRX performance sedans. After that you've gotta move to the Speed6/Legacy and then G35/3 series. Higher still would be the 5 series and yeah no others with even a manual.  So if one wants some measure of luxury that pretty much negates the WRX/Evo options instantly. Stupid fun cars but they always feel like what they are - bargain basement rockets.  Speed6 steps up the luxury but adds serious poundage and it uses a wonky Haldex AWD system. Legacy's got the performance part down but inside it feels cheap, cheap, cheap.  So we're right back at the G and 3 series.  When it comes right down to it, a performance sedan is not an easy car to come by. It's already a compromise vehicle as it seats 4-5 people, has 4 doors and thus must be kept to a certain shape/size.  Many of us feel we've compromised enough by going 4 door sedan. We're opting for a basic level of utility in exchange for a few moments each day of fun. We can compromise more and get a FWD vehicle or an auto-only car but to the few of us that repress our Speed Racer Id, we feel like we've given up enough for the sake of family, job, etc, so we're not backing down from our basic vehicular requirements.  I don't relish giving up RWD or a manual in my 4 door sedan. I'm living enough for others by getting a 4 door sedan - the hell if I'll surrender the last vestiges of fun I know in a car."

Do you believe someone drives a 328i with an msrp of 40k because it has a badge and they totally ignore the Lexus, Infiniti, Audi, MB, Acura models? There comes a point when you must look at the market and wonder if you're saying each year 90k out of 100k people bought a 3 series based on marketing, while the other 400-500k that bought other brands did so because they saw through BMW's marketing ruse."
3430,1487,March 2007,Do you have any stats to back up your assertion that most luxury buyers dont want cloth? That sounds very suspicious to me. The majority of luxury cars sold have leather and its standard on many models. Not sure why anyone would say most people want cloth or leatherette. Cadillac got cheap and started offering vinyl just like BMW on the CTS. Leather used to be standard.  If you dont like electronics and borderline useless technology BMW isnt the car for you. The GErmans are at the forefront of adding tech that no one asked for. Active steering anyone? Of course they do make most of this stuff optional which is kind of an indication that they know many buyers cant afford and/or dont want this stuff.

Many people deride Japanese luxury cars as imposters and feel they lack the prestiage and heritage of German luxury brands like BMW and MB. You can tell by looking at the people behind the wheel of most BMWs that they didnt buy the car for handling. On top of that, most BMWs I see lack the sport package which tells me the owner is a badge snob who wanted the propeller on the front to impress people. BMW has a great image and great marketing and people will stretch to make a payment on a BMW because it is seen as more envy worthy than an Acura, Infiniti, Cadillac, etc."

If we are going to consider the 3 series a performance sedan than it seems to me the G35, C class, IS, CTS and A4 could also be considered the same. I dont think the market for these type of vehicles is all that small. If we added up the yearly sales of all those cars I think we would have a substantial number of vehicles even if we acknowledge that not every model within the range of the aforementioned vehicles is a ""performance"" model.

AutoX maybe? A full track day at Button Willow? If you think you're hitting hyper legal speeds in any of the ELLPS during a track day, you're at the wrong kind of track. The best lap around a track may never break a top speed of 55 mph. Tracking is about getting the perfect line, transitioning the body weight for your next turn, looking for the right exit so you're positioned perfectly for that next turn's apex.  If you think it's about speed you've never tracked and never autoXed.  without the sport package a BMW is just another RWD car, very competent but nothing exceptional.

Lexus' number one seller is the RX350 (9k a month) - and it starts at $39,515 without leather! The smallest package adds 3500 dollars, pushing the price to 43k.  Lexus sells 9000 of those a month.

What is counterproductive about having wheels large enough to feel the wheel wells and give the car a sportier look?  Most automakers have dealer accessories, but we all know Honda is notorius for making relatively common options available solely from the dealership. The TL has most of what you need so most people can shy away from the accessories, but there is undoutedly an overpriced spoiler and set of larger rims waiting for you at the dealer. I dont see why this is necessary.  TL-S is fast, but I dont think speed was ever the base models problem. In terms of acceleration the base model is good enough for me. I just think $4k should get your more than a bigger engine and quad pipes. No other car company makes hi performance models and doesnt add larger wheels. Acura needs to join 2007 and put 18s on the S at least. The Civic Si and TL-S shouldnt have the same wheel size."

This coming July I'm looking at a journey to Inuvik (if you need to ask, you don't care). There's lots of fun stuff between here & there, & even though I'm used to late/early sunshine (lived in Edmonton) in the summer, I've never been above the Arctic Circle. Looking forward to it, in a big way.  These sorts of trips justify my owning whatever car I've got, and have since I was 20. Before that I owned motorcycles.  The last time I went north my 510 was making noises, so I borrowed the family Voyager & drove to Ft. Simpson & back. The trip was fun -- the vehicle. . .not so much.

Humor yourself - go look at the leather and stitching on the sport seats and door trim of a 911. Or even the leather Recaro seats in a $32k Honda S2000. That's the way it's supposed to look, IMO. And BMW's leatherette comes a heck of a lot closer to that than any ""supple"" leather that ever went through a GM factory. In fairness, I only rate my Acura TL as ""good"", certainly not excellent. But GM's supple (i.e. mushy) leather looks like it belongs on a retirement community sofa. And this isn't a cheap shot - I've been given enough Buicks and Caddys by Hertz and Avis over the years to have experienced GM leather quality - or rather lack thereof - first hand.  Clearly, we have different standards when it comes to measuring quality. If you find GM acceptable, great."

3455,hauss,March 2007,"I disagree with you 03accordman. My feeling is that the majority of 3 series buyers do not buy it for it's driving feel. I know several people that own them and I know for a fact that they got the car because they like the prestige and recognition of the brand; they like the the appearance of the car; and it's in their price range. And there's nothing wrong with that. Off the top of my head just one of my ten friends that owns one got it for the performance and he's got an M3 (the rest have 325i models). Also my term ""buying a badge"" is the phrase he uses all the time to describe those buyers I'm referring to.  Now, I'll admit that my little informal survey is hardly gospel. It's not statistically sound. But neither is your assumption that they get the car for it's (supposedly) superior chassis and suspension. And you cannot suggest that because most of the people on this forum agree with you that makes your viewpoint correct. Going that route would bias the data toward a more specific population of 3 series buyer.  And to joe131, I don't find the 3 series to be common nor the best of the ELLPS class. I think it's a good car. What I'll disagree with is everyone that thinks it's all that and a bag of chips. It's got a list of shortcomings just as long as every other car on here. If it were truly the ""ultimate driving machine"" the other auto makers would be struggling for any kind of market share in this segment. They are not. Last year BMW sold 88k 3 series sedans, Lexus sold 80k ES350s, Acura sold 70k TLs, Lexus sold 55K ISs... That's a lot of cars being bought by people not choosing BMW."

Or many people buying with an agenda for cheaper (TL), softer (ES), borderline performance without a sacrifice in luxury (IS). The 3 series doesn't appeal to many buyers for the simple fact it's more expensive than the competition, they find the seats hard, they find the ride hard.

Like those 1980s Motor Trend articles about which low priced cars give you the most performance per dollar. In this case, it seems most want luxury and some performance for the dollar.  Others see value in pleasure. They feel their pleasure in a car is worth X cost. They may value things others do not care about or they may discount elements some take as necessary.  eBay is a good example of personal valuation. Take two products that fulfill the same goal - like cell phones. Put them up for auction. One day you may get some nut who pays almost MSRP for a brand new Samsung SCH-U740. The other phone is a brand new Motorola V325 and it ends up selling for $100 less. Is that what the two products are worth? Well to the buyers, the products are worth at least that much because the bidding process found their personal valuations.  I hear about people paying 50k for a 335i with active steering, premium package, automatic, sun shade, laser cruise and navigation and feel shocked. My personal valuation of such a car is significantly lower than a 335i with just the sport package and manual. I would consider the previous car only if it were sharply discounted - at least 6-7k less than my price of a 6mt ZSP version.  BMW may mark the car at 50k; I'd mark it at 28k expressly because of the items on the car. My personal valuation is infinitely lower than the corporation's requested value. Neither side is right or wrong; we have differing views and thus will not find ourselves conducting a transaction on that product.  So when you say a G35 is the budget alternative, it could be to you. To someone who values other things - less perceptible differences - the G35 may represent a compromise that distorts that individual's personal valuation."

We can talk about subjective intangibles all day, but in the end you arent really giving up anything if you pass on the 3 series. The G35 has a better interior, slightly more room, lower price and likely superior reliability so I dont see any sacrifice. Sure, the G35 MAY come up short in a battle at the racetrack but I'm willing to bet most owners (even BMW owners) dont subject their car to that kind of environment.

I agree that many buyers don't value RWD and a manual; I value it more than leather or bluetooth. Neither side is right or wrong. They're placing value on things I see as detractors to the value of a car. They're negating value at times with some features.  The IS350 is worth less to me as a buyer - like my example of a loaded 335i - because it is outfitted with a transmission that retards my enjoyment of a car. How do I put a value on that? If RWD and manual fun has a baseline personal valuation of 35k to me, then how far does that drop an automatic equipped car?  Well in my value system that makes the car pretty much unlivable. I would probably rather FWD and a manual before ever owning a car with an automatic; having driven the IS350, its automanual is one of the worst I've ever experienced on a car. So, I'd say a RWD car equipped with a bad automatic must be worth less than the absolutely cheapest new manual FWD car I'd own: a GTI. A GTI runs 24k. So figure 22-23k is my valuation of any IS350. Regardless of features or content beyond the RWD and manual, I know I won't live with a traditional automatic.  Private valuation - we all have it. When we buy we've generally reconciled that our purchase meets a threshold where the cost to value is level in our heads. You expressed earlier that you don't see the value in ELLPS. Your private valuation of the group of vehicles is markedly less than the collected MSRPs and thus you will not strike a deal for one."

Now, how could the MKZ's automatic tranny make the car worth more to a buyer who specifically rates it against a manual car? The MKZ lacks stability control, yet it was dinged for this, while the 3 was given $25 for having DSC. Stability control is only worth $25?! The MKZ lacks a sport package and again this didn't hurt the MKZ's pricing. Obviously, the buyer wants manual and sport packaging; the system refuses to weigh options based on user desires.

Others place less value on this drivers experience and really want the doo-dads that differentiate these vehicles from their plebian relatives.  You make good points, but you seem to be at the other end of the spectrum with regards to where the value lies in the ELLPS segment than some other posters. Nothing wrong with that and you acknowledged it.  Honestly, the line about getting a luxury car equipped like an Accord is a bit condescending. It is after all my money I'm spending, not yours.  And I defend my right to defend the car of my choice. :P"

3533,fedlawman,March 2007,"know one thing, those features arent worth $4k in my book.""  What you are actually saying is that DVD-Audio, HIDs, leather-trimmed seats, and driver memory settings are features YOU place value in, but you place NO VALUE in RWD, dynamic cruise control, or brake fade compensation.  Your assertion that the TL (or CTS, G35, etc.) is a much better value than the 328i is nothing more than your personal value statement - it is not based on facts.  And how can it possibly be? We're talking about luxury items, which by their very nature, are driven by personal values. The ""facts"" show that all of these cars are a poor value compared to a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord. We are willing to pay more (much more) for these cars because they appeal to our emotional AND practical sides.  Saying that a Cadillac is a ""better value"" than a BMW is like saying that Aaron Copland was a ""better"" composer than Gustav Mahler. You can say it, you can even present some ""facts"" that support it, but you can never prove it."

You're right - the Camry and Accord are probably the best car out there that we need. Or even step down to a loaded Elantra for that matter. But there's a huge difference between need and want.  These guys that ""need"" a 46'' LCD 1080p flat panel HDTV can tell you how they're such a great experience etc., but if you watch one hour of TV a day you'd probably not be convinced of their value."
3536,fedlawman,March 2007,"Well, Mahler's First is available on DG for $7.99 while Fanfare costs $10.99 on EMI - although you do get Rodeo on the disc too.  Which is a better value?

And when I looked for JD Powers information I saw your link showing 2/5 for initial quality.  I thought he mentioned to look at what owners were saying on yahoo auto. I looked and saw a virtually perfect rating for the X Type wagon...based on 9 owners. The other 4 cars I looked up also had perfect ratings on yahoo autos (based on far more reviews). My take is that those owner reviews aren't worth much if virtually every car is rated perfectly...seems like owners (or dealers) are just going on there to try to make their choice look good.

3546,brightness04,March 2007,"It seems to me that ED + high lease residual + low MF make for the best deal: you only pay sales tax on the portion that is being depreciated in that year. Cash purchase of used cars seems to be very expensive considering the CPO premium and maintenance/repair cost.  The only big hitch with leasing new cars one after another is that I live in a state where excise tax is based on MSRP, which is way out of wack with how little these cars are really usually transacted for. A car at $277/mo lease should correspond to a real money market price of $18k or so not $34k! My excise tax bill under current tax code is nearly double what it should be."
3547,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"That sucks. In CA you're taxed on the payment, not the overall cost of the car. And yes, an ED lease on many BMWs is a sick deal. Hard to get into any car that cheaply - certainly cars with 40k stickers."
3548,jtla,March 2007,"Interest is something that exists whether you finance (therefore pay) or have the money in the bank (therefore collect).  Absolutely, and the best of both worlds is lease-to-own. BMW's lease deals on 3-series are so attractive that everyone should lease even if he/she intends to buy. Current money factor with 7 MSD for 328i is 0.00076(0.00125 - 0.00007*7) which is equivalent to an interest rate of 1.8%. Whether you pay cash or finance, an estimated 4% interest rate difference on a $40k car for 3 year would be around $3,800 (not $4,800 because the depreciated portion of car cost has been repaid through lease payment). If you purchase the car at lease-end, it is like you are getting additional $3,800 discount; if you return the car at lease end, not only do you save $3,800 in interest, you also save, say, 7% of sales tax on the residual value -- another $1,700 or so. The cost of the $5,500 potential saving? $625 lease acquisition fee plus approx. $500 ""lost interest"" of your 7 MSD."
3549,brightness04,March 2007,"Out here in Taxachusetts, we have to pay 5% sales tax on each payment, then every year there is an excise tax of 2.5% of ""table value""; the ""table value"" is 90% of MSRP in the model year, 60% MSRP MY-1 and MY+1, 40% MSRP MY+2, 25% MSRP MY+3 and 10% MSRP MY+4 and thereafter. As you can see, the tax code severely penalize cars that heavily discount from MSRP. It becomes a big deal when between ED and high residual, the consumer is only paying about 13% of MSRP worth of depreciation over two years (little over 6% each year); the excise tax adds as much as 25-35% to the first year's payment because of the inflated MSRP!  On the surface of it 5% + 2.5% is no big deal, not much more than the 7% in CA, but the real difference is that the 5% and 7% are assessed on payments, in other words the total tax base over the two years is only 13% of the car's MSRP (depreciated value, interest is negligible in these subsidized leases), whereas the tax base of the 2.5% excise tax is 150% of MSRP in the same two years."
3550,habitat1,March 2007,"Careful on the lease analysis vs. cash buy analysis. What makes the most economic sense is dependent upon your own personal ""money factor"" compared to the leasing companies, as well as what they claim the residual value is vs. what you think the depreciation will be. And, of course, what the capitalized cost is compared to the best negotiated cash price.  BMW is known to have aggressive lease terms and I have not done a direct comparison. But my personal money factor is 3.5% (I can margin borrow at 6% and the interest is effectively tax deductable from my other investment earnings). That is not the case for many or most people, but I know of others who took out home equity loans at 5.5%-6.5% that were fully tax deductable interest.  In the case of my 911, I compared the best lease deal I could get to my own ""self financed"" purchase deal and the difference was enormous - to the tune of $21,000 over 48 months. I am sure the difference would be a closer with a 335i, but i'm willing to bet that for those that can effectively borrow at an after tax rate of under 4%, it still is more expensive to lease than buy. There is no voodoo in leasing economics - you are adding another party to the equation and they need to make money. Unless they can give me funds at under 4%, they will be making it at my expense - even without their little acquisition and dispositon fees."
3551,jtla,March 2007,"While I generally agree with your ""cost of fund"" concept, I can't seem to get your $277/month payment with zero cap reduction. I think two items were missed in your example: $695 destination charge and $625 lease inception fee (assuming rolled-in). My calculation based on:  - $28,415 ED invoice for base 328i sedan 6MT no option - $1,000 dealer profit + $625 lease fee - zero cap cost reduction - single security deposit - 2 yr / 12k miles lease - MF .00125 + 0.0003 for ED - 73% residual  The payment for the above should be in the neighborhood of $330 before tax ($355 with 7.75% sales tax). March price may have gone up a tick."

A nice/any car is obviously not an investment, but short of giving the wife the boot and finding some young thang to roll around with, these cars provide the kind of pleasure putting a price tag on is low on the list (at least mine).  I agree with Blue - find the car you like and want, and then figure out how to pay for it, but don't worry about all the pennies."
3554,jtla,March 2007,"Unless they can give me funds at under 4%, they will be making it at my expense - even without their little acquisition and dispositon fees.  BMWFS' money factor on most 3ers is under 4% (2 or 3 years lease term), with max MSD can be under 2%."

The Jag dealer even came and rescued me when my Chevy pickup expired on the interstate this winter. Your statistics won't tell you if the grandkids won't fit in the back seat, if your luggage won't fit in the trunk, or if the damn car is a hand full when it snows or pours rain here in the mountains.

3558,joe131,March 2007,"Can somebody help me figure something out? I don't think anyone has ever explained how Acura's TL can even be considered as an ELLPS. Well, Acura has to be a luxury brand in the first place, right? Let's assume it is. Then there is the matter that an ELLPS must be the brand's entry level sedan, right? And there's the rub: the TSX is. The TL is NOT Acura's entry level sedan. How come every other brand has to play by the rules except Acura? Hmmmmmmmm...?  Automobile Magazine says: The TSX sedan is easily the finest in the Acura range and a credible rival to Audi's A4, Mercedes-Benz's C-class, and, yes, even BMW's 3-series.  Maybe this should be fixed by eliminating the TL and replacing it the the TSX."
3559,hauss,March 2007,That's an interesting point. But if we follow that logic we should also remove the Audi A4 from this discussion because the A3 exists and it has four doors. What about the IS350 and BMW 330i/335i? Are the IS250 and BMW 325i/328i inherently different enough from their sisters to exclude them? What about the MB C350?

Actually, the front seat of the A4 is the only car I've ever sat in that made me feel fat! I'm glad that the A4 isn't a glorified Jetta. I will definitely withdraw the inference I made.  The Germans automakers really don't believe in synergies, do they? Mercedes doesn't want to share too much with Chrysler, and BMW doesn't appear to care about lacking a mid-sized mass market sedan. I guess Audi and Lambo are the only ones that share.  The e46's backseat isn't that bad. However, I won't call it spacious for anyone above 5'10"".

It's especially sweet if you have enough miles saved up so your trip can be free.  On the other hand, if you don't have miles & don't have time off from work to get a vacation, then the $$ spent on the trip (however short lived it may be) narrows the gap you actually save by doing the ED program.  From my reading of the ED program on BMW's site, it seems like a pretty cool program i.e. if I ever to decide to get into a BMW.  Just my .02. Correct me if I'm wrong."

People who buy based on ED MSRP are the same rubes who buy cars at MSRP.  I assumed you would just have to take the car at MSRP - ED discount.  Nope. Start at the lowest price they pay and tack on a profit for them - most often 1k.  If I'm not mistaken, base ED invoice is $34,950 for the e92 (base MSRP is $40,800).

I don't mean that you should make them starve, however, I think $1,000 to $1,200 is more than enough profit for filling out a little paperwork. I mean, they are selling you a car that they wouldn't be able to sell were it not for the fact that you are willing to go to Europe to get it.  The ""proper"" way (IMHO) to buy (or lease) an ED car is to find out what the ED invoice is on the car, add the shipping charges, the invoice of any options you might want and say $1,000 for dealer profit. Then you make your local dealership an offer. Some dealers will take the deal, some won't. The dealership where I leased my first BMW from didn't.

Ford rushed the car to market before it was fully sorted out, and, pissed off a bunch of first time buyers. 2. By the 2003 model year, Ford had recalled and replaced all the bad trannys, and, addressed some of the other niggling problems. However, by then, Ford had really sullied the car's reputation. 3. The following model years continued to get better, Ford continued to improve the vehicle mechanically. However, they missed the boat by not introducing a larger engined ""R"" model to compete head to head with BMW, Infiniti, Etc. This would have reignited interest in the line. The car continued to move up in various quality surveys, but, few were paying attention. In addition, Jag's advertising department was and remains absolutely impotent. 5. Today, the car is vastly improved over what it was in 2002. Jag, too late in my opinion, has reduced prices and added features that make the car a relative bargain when compared to comparably equipped competitors. It still lacks a ""flagship"" model, and, its too late to introduce one now. At its current price point, its hard to beat, but, few consider it.

3586,oldcem,March 2007,"You don't have to be diplomatic. I was stupid enough - one time - to buy a Chevy Vega wagon with my GM employee discount. These cars actually developed surface rust while enroute to dealers on auto carriers. The cars had the worse brakes than the 1937 Dodge I once owned, and, went through front pads every 9K miles. The gas tank on my Vega rusted from the inside out and had to be replaced before the car had 1000 miles on it. If you drove the car over 75 on the interstate it used a bunch of oil because the head drains were undersized. I sold it when it was a year old, and switched to Oldsmobiles.  Regards: OldCEM"
3587,cdnpinhead,March 2007,"Yeah, I can see how you might come to your conclusion.  Here's the thing -- I want an RWD vehicle with a manual transmission that will carry my bicycle inside.  When the research is done, it becomes apparent that the list is really (really) short. Oh, BTW, I appreciate fuel mileage.  I'm locked into a BMW, unless I throw RWD under the bus, in which case, the A3 pops up. The C-series is (sorta) in the discussion, but not really (haven't mentioned electronic reliability yet, but will now).  3-series, A3 or CTS? Oh, wait, I forgot to mention that I've already been burned to the bone (& beyond) by buying an American Sports Sedan that left me holding the bag. CTS -- not gonna happen.  So, will it be: 1) BMW 3-series, 2) A3, or 3) my present (now beater) Lincoln LS that does what I want & doesn't cost one additional penny, month over month?"
3588,oldcem,March 2007,"Have to correct you on the X Type. Its not even close to a rebadged Mondeo. Only 20% of the X is derived from Mondeo - basically some suspension and brake parts, some electrical bits, some of the belly pan stampings, and some fuel lines. Having owned 2 of them and done a bunch of my own maintenance, the only part I've actually seen a Ford label on instead of Jaguar was one of the fuel lines. That ""Mondeo"" myth began after one of Jag management types mentioned at a press conference early on that the X shared some parts with Mondeo. The styling may not appeal to you, I can repect that, but I like the ""retro"" look of the X and S.  Regards: OldCEM"
3589,oldcem,March 2007,"Sorry to disagree. I've communicated on the Jag forums with people in Great Britian who actually own both cars. They indicate that there's a very substantial difference in the two. Besides if you do a little research you'll find that only 20% of Mondeo made it into the X. The chassis didn't make it, the brake parts and some belly pan stampings did. The 3.0 European X without the damn electronic limiter will do 150 according to the British drivers. Mine will only hit 121 before the limiter kicks in. The 3.0 liter Jag engine actually makes the same HP and torque as the BMW 3.0 in the new 328I. The Jag's a bit heavier and has AWD, so the 5 speed models hit 60 in 6.5 seconds. My 5 speed automatic takes 7.1. Forget the Mondeo reskin nonsense, its a myth. The BMW, if it'll really hit its EPA numbers, may get a bit better fuel economy. Don't know anyone here that owns a new one - the local dealer is awful.  Regards: OldCEM  Regards: OldCEM"

Then they look at the starting price and list of options and I hear them say ""yeah, but that's just for the base model with a stick shift & fake leather.""

3593,brightness04,March 2007,"I'd pick the BMW 328i over Hyundai Sonata Limited because the BMW is less expensive: put that $23000 in a bank account or treasury bills and it would earn you roughly $100 per month. A BMW 328i can be had for $277/mo lease with no cap reduction via ED. That's $177/mo out of pocket after subtracting the $100/mo interest income from the cash set aside. $177x24 = $4248. There is no way a two-year old Sonota Limited can resell for $18752 ($23000 - $4248)! With these lease numbers, BMW 328i is essentially equivalent to a car with a $18k price tag."
3594,oldcem,March 2007,"Actually, Edmunds is wrong, according to a Jag factory consultant that was active on one of the forums, the tech literature from the factory, and a number of Jag tech people who post. Edmunds also carped about the single cup holder up front for two years after Jag redid the center consol and added another one. Edmunds also reviewed the X Type wagon (3.0, automatic) and indicated that its performance was very good, comparable to sedans in this class. However their review of the sedan indicated that performance was subpar to similar sedans. Whoops, the sedan is a good bit faster to 60 than the wagon is. Sorry, inaccuracies like this make me wonder what the Edmunds people are smoking. I've also read articles stating with absolute authority that the car is a reskinned Taurus, or, a reskinned Contour. In addition, I know for a fact that the suspension and brakes in my 06 are substantially different from those in my old 03 model, because I do my own midpoint oil changes and tire rotations. The suspension members and the brake calipers are even differnt now. I suspect as part of Jags ongoing improvements. You also forget - the Mondeo was a front driver, the X is AWD with a huge driveshaft running the length of the car, equipped with a center bearing. Most power goes to the rear differential, unless slippage is detected, then it starts shifting to the front diff.

I was dissapointed that even after I politely asked the Caddy representative to see if I can touch the door panel to see what kind of material is used she still turned me down and re-direct me to the current model. Nicely done, Caddy.  However, in all fairness, Caddy is NOT the only manufacture to follow this exercise. This year in Atlanta Auto Show Toyota also put the new Highlander on display with the ""Look Only"" sign to it.

It is indeed cheaper to get a 3 series than getting a Sonata. I'm making that business decision precisely because a 3 series is cheaper to keep for a couple years than a Corolla or Civic! May as well give my employees a little incentive that doesn't cost me any extra, actually saving a few pennies even after counting the trip cost, which makes the European trip tax-writable.  As for whether cost is relevent, if someone wants to disqualify TSX on cost ground, we may as well examine what the real costs are for the other entries."

3608,jtla,March 2007,"You may choose to pay destination charge, lease inception fee, and sales tax up front instead of by monthly payment, but these costs still exist. Similarly, there is travel expenses involved, even if you have one million frequent flyer miles. The bottom line is, the true monthly cost to lease a 328i for 2 yr/12k mile is approx. $370 before tax, $400 after tax.  IMHO, saying that one can lease a 328i for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction, and thus a better deal than a Sonata is like false advertising. You would need to add fine print as (1) $2,100 up front cost to cover destination charge, lease inception, and sales tax; (2) $900 in travel expenses to Munich to pick up your car. Total $3,000 divided by 24 is $125. Add that to $277 you get $402.  Speaking of ad, the deal on BMW website is $329/mo with $2,500 down payment. It includes auto transmission ($1,210 option) but only 10k miles per year (1% residual difference), the effect to payment is about a wash. The true monthly cost is about $400 before tax. My example in previous post is $400 after tax."
3609,jtla,March 2007,"Sorry, didn't see louiswei's and your post earlier. This isn't really about lease or ED question. I just can't see people using misleading payment figure and compare 328i with Sonata. Anyway, I made my point, so I will just continue to enjoy reading all the fine posts on this forum."
3610,brightness04,March 2007,"Destination charge, lease inception vs. maitenance cost and sales tax all exist even if you decide to buy a Sonata. The $23000 MSRP suggested included none of that. If you really want to grind through the numbers including all the ancillary numbers, here we go for Sonata with cash purchase:  Invoice +$200profit: $21,732 (remember I gave the BWM dealer $1000 profit) Destination fee $650 7.7% sales tax: $1723 Maintenance in year1 and year2, per Edmunds: $1005 total out of pocket: $25110  Compare to leasing 328i via ED: placing that $25110 that would have paid for the Sonata in treasury bills at 5-6% becomes at least $27684 (at 5%) after two years Even at $300/mo (go plug in the numbers yourself), 24mo is only $6900 (BMWFS pays one monty) Destination: $700 Lease Inception: $625 Disposal charge: $325 flight and one-night accommodation: $1000 + $150 (just to be generous) total out of pocket: $9700  So after two years, $27684 - 9700 = $17984  Do you honestly believe that a two year old Hyundai Sonata can resell for $17984? The case is not even close. Not sure why you even bother debating me on this. Even if you tag on another $50/mo to fatten the dealer, do you believe a 2-year old Sonata can sell for $16750? The number is the same if you insist on $400/mo but wipe off the Euro trip allowance of $1150 above. Like I said, the numbers are not even close; why do you even bother to debate me on this? Frankly if you insist on $400/mo, we should recaculate and use MSRP+$5000 for the Sonata as apparently the hypothetical consumer is fond of paying more than the manufacturer suggested price."

Is it below $292/mo with no cap reduction? and free maintenance included?  BTW, I agree with you entirely on the influence of these lease deals. I'm choosing the 328i/X3 over Corolla/Camry RAV4 for my employees based on the fabulous lease deals. That's why we have to use the least expensive way of getting a car as a measure of how much a car is really worth."
3613,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"I think your math is way, way off. Just go get your employees two Mazda3s, negotiate two cars at $100 over invoice (thus avoid cap cost) and you're looking at around $200 a month per car.

3614,brightness04,March 2007,"I don't see anything about waiving cap reduction. $2000+ cap reduction works out to about $75/mo in payment. Maintenance is about $700 for the first two years according to Edmunds; that means another $25/mo. Hmm, $292/mo for a 328i or just over $300/mo for a stripped down hatchback with 100 less horsepower . . . I will take the 328i :-)"
3615,jtla,March 2007,"As others and the host have spoken, this is probably not a subject belongs here, so I will make it short.  I can't care less about Sonata. All I am saying is that you cannot spend all those up front money and claim it costs you $277/mo to lease a 328i. If that is the true cost to you, I would like to lease one from you. Heck, I will even let you mark up 10%."
3616,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"You're totally ignoring your other costs so you can arrive at a fallacious magic number. The fact is a BMW lease is going to add on the $625 acquisition fee, 1 month payment without use of the car, cost to retrieve car and cost to replace car after only 22 months in service. These costs cannot be ignored if you're performing any real cost analysis.  Over the course of 24 months even at your fake $300 a month rate (multiplied by 23), you're looking at:  Lease cost $6900 (but only 22 months of use) Extra cost: $625 Retrieval cost: $1200 (bare minimum as there's also transportation costs in Munich) Tire replacement cost: $1000 (with 30k miles there's no way the car's RFTs will be in good enough shape to return the car with same shoes)  9725/22 months of use = $442 per month and the other two months you will have to pay for something else...  Add in gas expenditures too! A 328i can reasonably get 21 mpg combined using 2008 standards. 15k miles / 21 mpg = 714 gallons per year. Premium gas is at least $3 a gallon. That's $2142 per year on just gas."
3617,blueguydotcom,March 2007,lol  No kidding. Send brightness to get the cars for all of us.
3618,brightness04,March 2007,"I simply answered a rhetoric question by stating that I would pick a 328i over a $24k Sonata on pure cost consideration, because leasing a 328i would cost a lot less than paying $24k for a Sonata. If you don't care about Sonata and more importantly can't be bothered with simple arithmatics, you should have thought through before accusing me of anything. 328i can be leased at sub-$300/mo without any capital reduction. Every lease comes with acquisition fee; tax, title, insurance and gas are extra for any car, lease or purchase . . . almost all cars excepting BMW's also incurr maintenance expense. There is nothing misleading about it. I don't waste my time in business where my markup is only 10%. On the other hand, BMW dealers are quite willing to fill some paperwork for you for a $1000 profit without any cutting into their allocation. The numbers I mentioned already included $1000 profit for the car dealer."

3624,thechoson,March 2007,"The first car in this segment I got to drive for an extended time was the 06 325i, which I rented last year for a weekend trip down to San Diego from LA.  My everyday drivers had been a Maxima and Civic, so this BMW blew me away. I can't really describe it, other than saying I felt like I was in total control of the car the entire time. Usually I am discouraged from speeding not just by the speed limits, but by the capability of the car. Cars seem to hit a speed where it just feels extremely dangerous and a bit out of control.  I was doing 100-110 mph at certain areas with the BMW, and I never felt out of control at all. I felt in total control at 35 or 100 mph.  The acceleration was also amazing, for a 215 hp engine. It felt much faster, and the thing that I was taken by was the it gave me the right acceleration at every point. What I mean by this is I've driven cars faster linearlly (a 3.5 Altima for example), but some of those cars just seem like a cannon ball, fast but a bit out of control. The 325i seemed fast in a useful sense, giving me the right acceleration at every point.  Also, I was doing this thing where no matter how fast I was going, I could keep myself focused on the edge of the lane divider, and along curves, just hit that lane divider perfectly where I felt like, almost like controlling a video game car or something. It just felt so in control.  Now, having said that, here is my question. Is all this I'm describing a BMW thing, or is it more of an ELLPS thing? Will I get this type of drive in cars like the G35 or TL, or is this type of drive what makes BMW BMW?"

3628,1487,March 2007,Just because I dont put the 3 on an unreachable pedastal doesnt mean I believe the CTS is perfect. The current model is far from perfect. The new one could be pretty close though. We shall see in a few months.
3629,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"Maybe he rated several elements of the cars and when it was all said and done the 330i came up short on power. That shortness of power, matched to a possibly higher price pushed him to consider the G35 as a better choice. Now that the power is comparable the cars may not line up evenly.  On another board I listed about 10-12 categories and rated the 3 cars in that segment. The one with the lowest score was the winner in my eyes.  Ergonomics Ride Handling Power Transmission Projected Reliability Projected Resale Cost Features Tunability Interior Materials Trunk Space Maintenance Costs Gas Mileage Interior Space  Obviously you can also make one of two categories your ""trump"" category. If the car has a 1 for this specific category it's equivalent to a -1 (ie, it's weighted more heavily).  I'm not saying this is for everyone but I can see how someone might rate the power low on the 06 330i and in the end see the G35 or IS350 winning, while the 335i now trumps all comers in power so his focus may have shifted."

Once it has been stated that one is totally biased in favor of one particular vehicle without regards to facts about performance, price, handling, styling, quality, etc. it becomes hard to take that person's evaluations of other cars seriously. Why bother to comment on cars other than the 3 if one has no interest in acknowledging the merits of those cars? I dont like the camry but there arent any legit reasons I could tell someone to stay away from the car. Its a great car for getting from A to be in comfort but it's not for me. I cant with a straight face say its a joke or insult those who chose to drive it."
3631,1487,March 2007,"I wouldnt go so far as to say I am frustrated at all. I'm not surprised by the reaction here at all, I'm just surprised that so many have been consumed by the BMW marketing machine. The 3 is a very popular car and those kinds of cars generally do have a strong following. its the same thing with any upbiquitous model like the Accord, Camry, RX, etc. Fans of top sellers often believe that sales are the ultimate proof of a car's excellence when it's convenient. You wont hear any import fans saying the Impala is a great car because it sold nearly 300k units last year, but they will be quick to use sales as a way to prove excellence when talking Camry, Accord or Altima. If we are to go by the ""most sales equals best car"" than the 3 is undoubtedly king.  I dont know that I have ""attacked"" the 3 at all, in fact that is kind of funny. The 3 series doesnt have many flaws to talk about but the problem is that it's excellence does not make it's competitors nulll and void. Point is most of the cars being discussed here are excellent and some people seem incapable of accepting that. The 3 may be great but its competition is very good. Some here have contended that not only is the 3 best in class, but its peers are totally unacceptable for the savvy sports sedan shopper. I dont buy that for a second. The people at GM, Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, etc. are not stupid and they know what it takes to make a sporty sedan, even if BMW has been at it longer. I suppose it is blasphemous around here to suggest we are close to parity in this segment but someone had to make the statement. If we want to go back to the status quo BMW praise fest I'll give up and join the chorus."
3632,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"If I did the 15 categories I stated above, the CTS ends up dead last.  335i = 32 G35 = 45 A4 = 49 TL = 50 IS350 = 60 CTS = 82  I didn't include styling in my criteria as that holds zero sway over my decision. I didn't give any bonus points either. Straight up, my rankings are just my opinion on every element."
3633,fedlawman,March 2007,"""so in summation the 3 series is flawless and every other car in the class is seriously compromised and totally unworthy of consideration. Got it""  And you wonder why you get such strong responses here? Why do you have to be like that?  NOBODY here has ever said the 3-series is flawless. The only thing I've seen repeatedly is the opinion that it is the best ""performance sedan"" in this class, with the G35 coming in a close 2nd place.  We've said repeatedly that if ""ultimate performance"" isn't your priority, then the G35 or TL is probably a better choice.  My problem with your statements has been (and continues to be) that you refuse to admit that the BMW's performance advantage, however great or slight you think it is, doesn't count for a hill of beans. We're talking in a ""performance car"" forum, and the best performing car on the list isn't worth consideration because only badge snobs and poseurs drive them? And you know this because you've looked at people driving BMW's and you can just tell they're not enthusiasts.  A number of us here are passionate about performance, and if we didn't need a back seat and trunk on a regular basis, we'd probably be driving a Cayman or Z4 Coupe - I know I would. For many of the people shopping for an ELLPS, they are looking for a car that is the CLOSEST THING to a sports car that has four doors and some luxury thrown in.  These are the people that don't want the FWD handling of the TL or the hanging revs/awkward clutch engagement of the G35. I had high hopes when all the buzz first came out about the Lexus IS350. I imagined a sport sedan with the reflexes of a 3-series with the reliability of a Lexus. Well guess what? Lexus pulled the trigger but they missed the bullseye. Same for Infiniti - it's close, but dynamically, it's still a notch below the BMW.  If infiniti or Lexus would build a better BMW, I'd buy one. Until then, BMW is still the only game in town for an enthusiast."
3634,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"Point is most of the cars being discussed here are excellent and some people seem incapable of accepting that.  I'd say you're pretty liberal with the term excellent then. I would at best on a scale of 1 to 10 rate a 335i with ZSP and 6 speed a 7. More likely a 6 with RFTs. But I'm a very hard marker and the BMW 335i has several deficiencies I can't overlook: weight, size, interior size, RFTs, mileage, power, transmission, body roll, reliability, cost, resale.  The 3 may be great but its competition is very good. Some here have contended that not only is the 3 best in class, but its peers are totally unacceptable for the savvy sports sedan shopper.  I'd rank most of them 4s and 5s.  I suppose it is blasphemous around here to suggest we are close to parity in this segment but someone had to make the statement. If we want to go back to the status quo BMW praise fest I'll give up and join the chorus.  I don't see parity. But then again ask me about 5 restaurants and I can rattle off exactly what I like and don't like at each one. I see clear lines pretty instantly when it comes to critiquing anything involving my money, my stomach or my time."
3635,blueguydotcom,March 2007,"If infiniti or Lexus would build a better BMW, I'd buy one. Until then, BMW is still the only game in town for an enthusiast.  Amen. I recall being crestfallen when I first read the IS350 would come only with an automatic. Of course, then I drove it, saw Lexus' pricing and their inane ""ordering"" scheme. G35 is still the second best choice but I sure wish Infinit would make it a tougher choice."
3636,fedlawman,March 2007,"The internet is starting to buzz about the April issue of Car and Driver Magazine's shootout between the G35 and 328i.  According to C&D:  ""The G35 scores points for comfort, capable moves, and thrust in surplus, but BMW still builds the best tools for driving.""  About the G35 - ""...ubiquitious VQ series 3.5-liter V-6...generates stocky midrange torque and, when kept below 4500 rpm keeps the many [Nissan and Infiniti users of the engine] scooting with authority...[but] things go less tickety-boot at high rpms, with vibrations up the shifter and through the floor betraying the rapid percussions of big-bore pistons.""  In summary, CD said, the G35 Sport has ""all the ingredients except refinement.""  About the 328i - ""BMW&#146;s 3.0-liter silk-weaver...simply can&#146;t be detected through the stick, steering wheel, or pedals...the steering operates with light effort but delivers copious road data...longer drag-strip times [but] who cares when rips to redline are such exquisite pleasure?""  Bottom line, said Car and Driver, the 3 Series is ""worth the extra expense over the Infiniti."""
3637,nyccarguy,March 2007,"You've definitely got it all wrong when it comes to the 3 series fans (myself included) being blinded by the Ultimate Marketing Machine (BMW). We're very open to new things (with the exception of the CTS, I don't care how good it is GM suckered me into giving me their money once...NEVER AGAIN). We were excited when the new IS350 was on its way with 306 hp and RWD (personally I think the 1st gen IS300 is a better driving car). We all wanted to like the 1st Generation G35 and we wanted to like the 2nd generation G as well. The cars just fall short of some people's high expectations.  Many BMW fans and owners have openly criticized the E90 3 series for being overweight, too big, not as driver oriented, and even more disconnected than the previous body style. But we just like to drive home the point that even though it isn't as good as the good old days, we still like it the best in today's ELLPS segment."
3638,louiswei,March 2007,"I am sorry...  But wanting every other ELLPS, that's including IS350, G35, CTS and TL to be like the 3-series does not qualify as ""open minded"" to me. Me personally I think what makes today's ELLPS market so interesting is because every car has its owner personality instead of being another 3er with a different badge."
3639,nyccarguy,March 2007,"That is one way to think of it. But you have got to be kidding yourself if you think that the likes of Lexus, Infiniti, Cadillac, and Audi didn't build their respective cars for the sole purpose of competing (sales and performance) with the 3 series."
3640,brightness04,March 2007,"Well, E30 would very much be a boyracer compared to E46 and E90. 200hp was about what most E36 and E46 had (some as low as 168hp), much more than what typical E30 had. Pedigree, well, that's for pets :-)"
3641,brightness04,March 2007,"I have shared that conventional wisdom with you for much of my driving life. All my cars, excepting one, were paid with cash. That view is being severely challenged in recent years in the face of vendor financing. Blueguy has it well covered from the financial perspective. I just want to point out also that, after a model cycle (or even less), whatever we buy today would be either a boyracer or a family car by the standards of that time, not really ELLPS so even if had cost less it would be an apples-to-oranges comparison. Thankfully, we don't even have to choose between money and being to date nowadays; a bit odd, yes."
3642,kdshapiro,March 2007,"I agree. See a lot of Porsches, Ferraris, Maserati in Manhattan also. Lot of poseurs out there driving very expensive and sport cars in 5 mph traffic. Shame on those poseurs, giving these high-brow brands a bad name."
3643,bruceomega,March 2007,"hauss,  Yes, I like that, each to his own!  I will say that my previous car, an 01 3 series, was a much more snug fit than my current car.  Bruce"
3644,mariner7,March 2007,"See a lot of Porsches, Ferraris, Maserati in Manhattan also. Lot of poseurs out there driving very expensive and sport cars in 5 mph traffic.  Who's kidding whom? That's exactly what Porsche, Ferrari et al want! That's how they sell so many cars and make so much money! That's one main reason why Ferrari is in Formula 1, to sell sex appeal.  If every Ferrari driver has to pass a Michael Schumacher test, Ferrari would be a fraction of its current size. BMW knows most M5 drivers can't be trusted to use even half its full power, and yet every new M5 has even more power!"
3645,kdshapiro,March 2007,"My friend, I believe these generalizations can be applied to most any high-brow performance brand, even Infiniti and Lexus. So I'm not sure of the point except people buy the cars they buy for their own reasons."
3646,circlew,March 2007,"Interesting Edmunds track test indicates the bar has been raised as expected. The limp-home thing was also a good sign that the Germans have more work to do on the turbo performance/reliability.  We will see coming feedback on this comparo but I personally expected improvements in the G and the weight factor still hinders performance as some of the more intuitive posters here have noted. The '08 coupe weighs in at 3,571# vs. 3,682# 335 coupe and the 9/10 test shows G on top for the out of the corner acceleration/control for this test. 0-60 was not compared here.  It looks like Infinity has done a commendable job keeping their offering razor close to expected competition at the top of the sister to this category with their coupe.  Regards, OW"
3647,victord1,March 2007,"It looks like Infinity has done a commendable job keeping their offering razor close to expected competition at the top of the sister to this category with their coupe.  Yeah, I certainly hope so. And they definitely have to polish out the rough edges. In the April C&D comparo the G35 lost to the 328i due to the lack of ""refinement"". IMO, that's quite pathetic, considering C&D favored the G35 over the 325i a few years ago.  I also read Edmunds preview of the G37 coupe. I thought the 335i ""limp mode"" part was funny. Looked like the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" was reduced to the ""Ultimate Crawling Machine"". :sick: On the plus side, it's better to be crawling than not moving at all."

If the sole mission of the cars in this class was to mimic the 3 these cars would be just like the 3. While good handling is a geneal goal shared by these vehicles, I wouldnt say they are all designed to be clones of the 3 series. If that is the case the CTS would be smaller, the A4 wouldnt offer FWD, the TL would be smaller and RWD, etc. The 3 series competitors try to offer their interpretation of a sports sedan and to BMW loyalists any car that doesn't replicate the 3 exactly is a joke."
3649,andres3,March 2007,"Maybe there is a RWD Audi in the future some time some day?  If not, they could make a higher aluminum content/lighter weighted frame and structure/body Audi A3 and offset the added weight of Quattro thereby making the 2.0T a great choice w/ AWD."
3650,pat,March 2007,Maybe you could find or create a dedicated BMW discussion to continue this latest thread. It would be good if we could get back to discussing the features of some of the rest of the cars instead of focusing so much on bimmer engines alone.
3651,booyahcramer,March 2007,Thanks - I was waiting for the hook from you.
3652,pat,March 2007,"Okay, here ya go! I moved a bunch of posts to a new discussion that I think many of you will enjoy. Check it out: BMW History and Engine Technology.

3653,brightness04,March 2007,"Thank you, Pat for moving some of the BMW-specific details. This is a response to a question regarding other ELLPS that habitat had (and the answer wouldn't quite fit in the new forum):  I'm not familiar with S2000, but the TL has fluid-fill engine mounts controlled by piezo electric driver that are fed data by engine piston position sensors. That's why TL achieved nearly complete engine-vibration free cabin and steering long before BMW 3 series did, regardless the intrisic virtues of I6 vs. V6. Nowadays, just about any engine geometric configuration can be made smooth enough to let the electronicly controlled fluid-filled engine mounts to take over and smother out the last bit of vibration. For 6 and more cylinders, intrinsic smoothness due to inter-piston layout geometry is about as relevent to today's cars as who made the best carberretor; i.e. not a heck lot. Some manufactuers are going so far as to make modular V6's that are 90 degrees and narrow-angle V6's that have angles much less than the cannonic 60 degree V6's, all counting on engine mounts to reduce vibration for them. It's a great idea that Pat moved much of the arcana BMW engine discussion to a different forum, because much of the supposed historical superiority really have little to do with today's ELLPS that have much more advanced technology to make some of the old characteristics quite irrelevent.  ps. Thanks, Pat, for suggesting the change to post title. Done."
3654,louiswei,March 2007,"Let's leave the Bimmer alone for a minute shall we... :P  When I was ""taking care of business"" yesterday at the house I saw the February issue of the R&T laying around so I picked it up and start reading the Japanese ""sporty sedans"" comparison for the second time. Although I generally agree with the verdict but would like to share my point of view since I did test drive both the G35S, TL-S before and currently own an IS350.  My ranking:  3. TL-S  Pros: - Good Value. Although the sticker is at $38K, one can easily get one for around $35K which is a lot of car (and gadget) for that price. - Confident handling for a FWD. - Best interior in terms of design in this segment. - Optional manual transmission  Cons: - Nose heavy feeling. This is obvious since it's a FWD and probably wouldn't bother too many people whom moved up from their current mid-sizer. - Lack of power in terms of competition. 280HP and some change is definitely not weak but since its major competitors are all in the 300 range, it could certainly use some boost in this department. - Interior cost cutting. fake CF, fake wood, low quality material for door panel handles. Nothing major but worth mentioning IMO.  Bottom Line: Excellent car as a mid-sizer step up and good ELLPS but don't pay MSRP for it.  2. G35S  Pros: - Improved interior over the previous model. The new interior looks elegant, especially the washi aluminum trim. - Best handling in all Japanese ELLPS. - Good value. Similar equipped, it is considerably cheaper than competitors, Japanese or not. - Optional manual transmission.  Cons: - Interior cost cutting. Hard plastic being used for lower part of the door panel. This issue is not major but shouldn't happen for a car that's in the $30K-40K range. - Strange position for control buttons. Infiniti decided they are better off facing upward instead forward (or to the drive). Why? I don't know. - The new VQ. Although rated at 306HP, it is slower than Toyota's 2GR-FSE and BMW's twin-turbo 6 in terms of both driving feel and statistic. Lack the low RPM boost.  Bottom Line: Excellent performance sedan for the price and if you are a so-called ""enthusiast"" with a preference of Japanese make this is the one to get.  1. IS350  Pros: - One of the best interiors in this segment. Material used is top-notch, excellent fit-and-finish - Smooth and powerful V6. The 306HP 2GR-FSE is capable to push the car from 0-60 in less than 5 seconds according to R&T and that's faster than an Audi S4. This car is wicket fast in ECT sports mode. - Lots of standard gadgets. - Good balance between sporty and luxury. - Smooth 6-speed auto tranny  Cons: - No manual tranny available. - Tight interior space. - Cheap (although not cheap looking) metallic trim instead of real aluminum. - Handling not as crisp as the competition, has more isolated steering feel. - Intrusive VDIM system. It's good that on the 2007 model Lexus decided to put a VDIM-off switch. Too bad that us 06' owners still have to resort to the ""tap dancing"" method.  Bottom Line: Offers excellent balance between performance and luxury, argubly one of the best ""all-around"" entry-level luxury performance sedan on the market. As long as one doesn't race it on the track."
3655,1487,March 2007,"I agree about the G35 interior, the press have given it a free ride on this but its hardly class leading. I found all sorts of hard plastic and slightly cheap touches inside. The LOOK is fine, but the details are not up to Lexus or BMW standards. Same applies to the TL although to a lesser extent. I was also surprised the G has fixed rear headrests which isnt something you commonly find in Japanese sedans."
3656,hauss,March 2007,"Overall a nice review. Here are other comments from my vantage point:  TL-S: Best interior ergonomics among the three. Most spacious of the 3. Worst looking wheels among the three. Also, it's a shame they don't offer 18"" factory wheel option (you can get them dealer installed). Best stereo among the three. Auto tranny should be 6 speed.  G35: Interior ergonomics have improved but are still poor for a car in this segment. Interior design is choppy compared to TL and IS350 but is much improved over last generation. For a car of it's size (exterior) the interior is a bit cramped.  IS350: Most expensive of the 3. Aside from hard plastic on grip side door panel handles are same material as TL-S (rubber)."
3657,louiswei,March 2007,Best stereo among the three.  Have you compare TL's stereo to IS's Mark Levison? I have to admit that I am not big into stereo systems but it'll be nice to find out why one is better than the others.
3658,hauss,March 2007,"I was going by the general standard stereos with my comment but to your point the premium Mark Levinson systems Lexus uses are stellar and just as good as Acura's ELS surround sound system. Lexus lists it as a stand alone option but that's really only if you're willing to special order the vehicle that way. I think the option packages it comes with is about $3800. Plus, you'll likely have a hard time finding one with just that option package - there will be other options included. That drives up the price. In my experience the only IS350s I've seen with the Mark Levinson stereo are well into the $40k's. So, that's why I'd say the TL stereo is better based on the cost factor and that it's in every vehicle."
3659,andres3,March 2007,"In 2004 when they first came out, that was reason enough and alone to buy a TL! Do they still play DVD-A?"
3660,circlew,April 2007,"Yes, KD, I agree the competition will keep things in perspective.  I still point out that when I test drove the e90, the size seemed smallish to me but livable.

3681,bruceomega,April 2007,"wale_bate1,  I think you answered the so what. It all depends on what your requirements and priorities are.  In my own case, if the car is primarily for 1 or 2 people, and only an occasional back seat rider or 2, then the 3 series is more than adequate for me.  But if I want to carry 1 or 2 passengers in the back seat on a regular basis, or for long distances, then the 3 series is not a good choice, for me.  We have another car that fits passengers in the back seat more comfortably than the 3 series sedan, an X3. I find it quite roomy, especially considering its only 1.6 inches longer. But that doesn't rule out my interest in one day having a sedan with more back seat room so we don't always have to take the X3 when we have 3 or 4 in the car.  I'm surprised you consider the IS oversized.  Thanks Bruce"
3682,bruceomega,April 2007,"hauss,  I was saying the back seat of the GS-350 was about as tight as a 3 series. In fairness, it was not as tight as the 3 series.  I cannot get into the back seat of my 3 series with the seat in my driving position. In the GS-350, I could get into the back seat, but it took a lot of work and I felt really snug once there. The biggest problem for me was trying to get back out - that took a lot of work. This was in contrast to the roomier back seats for other cars in that category, such as the M35/M45.  Thanks Bruce"
3683,blueguydotcom,April 2007,"Seriously, are we talking a quick drive of about 150 miles (less than two hours), 300 miles (3-4 hours)?

For comparison an e46 330i was less than 3300 lbs. That's a big, big jump and no amount of HP will offset the physical bulk now added to the vehicle.  They didn't add 300+ lbs of safety to the new 3 series. They simply fattened the calf with an assortment of worthless add-ons (sound deadening being one of them)."
3684,hauss,April 2007,"bgdc, I don't think you'd want to spend even 5 minutes in the back seat of louiswei's IS350 with him driving it in his normal driving position. We'd have a hard time stuffing you in there (I think you'd just have to lay down on the seat in the fetal position). But maybe he'd be nice enough to sacrifice some leg room for himself and slide the seat forward."
3685,fedlawman,April 2007,"Hauss, the TSX is a great car, but you cannot use racing as a benchmark. I was a TSX owner when the TSX hit the Speed World Challenge, and I really enjoyed watching the Acura mix it up with the BMW 3-series.  During the TSX's first year, it gave the BMW a very good run for the money, but Bill Auberlein and the E46 325i dominated the series. In an effort to even the field, the following year SCCA handicapped the 3-series with more ballast and throttle body restrictor plates - it worked. The BMW dropped down to a mid-field runner and Auberlein et al left the series, only competing in a handful of races (which they still managed to finish on the podium).  The TSX is a terrific sedan with great potential for performance (and lots of aftermarket speed parts available). On the street, it's a worthy competitor to the E46 325i (and a luxury/performance bargain). On the track, it's FWD layout and forward biased weight distribution puts a damper on the fun.  I started doing HPDE's back in 2003 and to my mind, rather than tweak the TSX and try to turn it into a more balanced sport sedan with better tires, thicker rear sway bar, more HP, etc, I decided I'd much rather start from scratch and get a proper RWD sport sedan - which is why I sold my TSX and bought a BMW 2 years ago.  On paint chips - try this kit. http://www.touchup123.com/default.aspx? I bought the basic kit for my M3 a few months ago, and with great care and patience, I repaired numerous chips to the point that I won't get the car re-sprayed like I originally planned. Here's a before and after shot of my front bumper (the white chips in the after photo are new chips I've acquired since doing the repair (the Pacific NW is very hard on car finishes!).      You can still see the repairs if you get in close and look, but they don't jump out and grab you like they used too."
3686,kominsky,April 2007,"If I remember correctly, it was worse than simply adding ballast, they were making him add it to the front of the car only... not allowing him to keep the 50/50 weight distribution."
3687,fedlawman,April 2007,"Yes, you're right - but it wasn't just Auberlein. All of the E46s had to comply."

It's silly how a new 3 series is heavier than a 96-02 Mercedes E-Class. It's only 100lbs lighter than this:  http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1991-to-1996-buick-park-avenue-4.htm  Something's just wrong if the smallest cars are now almost as heavy as a ten year old Park Avenue.

Even that wouldn't be apples to apples, because American cars have always been huge, whereas European started out tiny and got progressively larger. Porsche and Ferrari started racing cars with I4's!  BMW still builds a lightweight car, it's called 116i. The reason they don't export it here, Americans with money to burn prefer a heavyweight 335i. Thank you very much!"
3701,texases,April 2007,"Yep. ""quiet...cocooned...isolated...luxurious"" I guess that's why they dropped the ""ultimate driving machine"" slogan."
3702,kdshapiro,April 2007,"junk. Don't know about the new model, but the old model had nothing good going for it. For those who don't need space for 4 people and luggage or can buy multiple cars, you can have the RX8/Vette/S2000. For those who need to carry 4 people and luggage and don't want to buy another car because their first car has some space deficiencies, the choice is more limited if you want more of a sporty feel."
3703,blueguydotcom,April 2007,"Actually, I had an 07 Altima as a loaner for 2 days while my 06 e90 was getting its AC replaced. It's a pretty big step over the last gen Altima and definitely superior to the current Camry/Accord for driver feedback/content for the dollar.  Is it on the level of a 33k 328i? No. But it's significantly cheaper."
3704,blueguydotcom,April 2007,"I guess that's why they dropped the ""ultimate driving machine"" slogan.  Golly, marketing slogans are always truthful. Having driven the e90 across Europe at well over 100 for hours - including ripping down the autobahn at 140+ for extended periods - I can say without hesitation that the car is isolated, cocooned and not very involving. 120 feels just like 50. The car's muted and lacks any verve. I put 1400 miles on my e90 in europe: if you want a car that handles sharply, responds to input without fuss and rarely falters in twisties, it's above reproach in this segment. If you desire excitement and edge of your seat fun...look elsewhere."
3705,plekto,April 2007,"For those who don't need space for 4 people and luggage or can buy multiple cars, you can have the RX8/Vette/S2000.  Actually, the RX8 seats four people quite nicely.  My point is that they can make a car like the Altima size-wise, and keep it light. BMW and others surely could make a smaller car much lighter if they wanted to. I notice a lot of BMW drivers switching to smaller cars like the MX-5 and the WRX and so on. BMW needs that 1 series fast or they're going to lose their entire performance market in a decade.  Oh - the M model of the 1 series(not to be confused with the M1) is an absolute winner. Fast, good looking, reasonably affordable, light enough...  But not in the U.S. DUH."
3706,papsephus,April 2007,"If you want to have a sports car that is feather light with high horsepower then you are going to have to modify it yourself. There are two words that prevent manufacturers from building what you want....""Industry Standards"". The government is requiring more and more from manufactur in terms of industry standards, which is why the lesser expensive cars aren't so inexpensive anymore.  Remember BMW's M3 CSL? It took out all of the sound deadening meterial and all the other stuff to decrease weight, but how many of them did you see here in the US?  Now they are resorting to carbon fiber (not just BMW) to reduce weight, which is a very expensive way to do it."
3707,louiswei,April 2007,"Or BMW can just make 3-series an aluminum frame like the 5er has. Of course, with the current 335i starting at around $40K one can only imaging how much an all-aluminum-frame-3er will cost..."
3708,kdshapiro,April 2007,"""My point is that they can make a car like the Altima size-wise, and keep it light""  The Altima (pre-07) to me is an extremely unsafe car that I would hate to get into an accident. It drove terribly, wasn't particularly reliable, and the sheet metal buckled when a leaf hit it. So yes, a light car can be made, but the compromise isn't worth it. I know this is OT, but for the RX-8 ones mans' cavernous back-seat is another mans' claustrophic trap. You can have lightweight cars, but there are very few that handle decently where there is a modicum of room for ""real"" family activities."
3709,plekto,April 2007,"I never said the RX-8 was ""cavernous"". I just stated that it does fit four people. And honestly, beside kids, who carries people in the rear of their car except on the occasional trip to the airport, party, or similar one-time exception?  You don't need 3600lbs to be ""safe"". The old Volvo 240, which was one of the safest cars ever, barely weighed 2600lbs when it came out. By 1993, it had bulked up with airbags, ABS, and so on, but was still under 3000 lbs by a healthy margin.(2919 lbs)  The bloat is pure and simple frills like sound deadening and electronics and so on. Nothing to do with crash safety."
3710,brightness04,April 2007,"The Vette ride quality improved dramaticly too in those 20 years. The new Vette is actually quite a smooth ride on highways. IMHO, the difference Tex mentioned in vette vs. 3 series is that:  1. Just like Mariner mentioned, Vette hasn't changed much in vehicle size whereas the 3 series today is bigger than 5 series of 20 years ago. In fact, the wheelbase of today's 3 series is nearly half a foot longer than the wheelbase of 5 series of 20 years ago. The Europeans are finally making American sized cars because they are no longer facing material shortage (relative to labor) like they did decades ago. The European/British sportscar tradition was literally born of a necessity after WWII when they had little natural resources but a lot of mouths to feed; they had to make something to trade for food import, turning import steel to cars was one of the solutions. That's why the value to weight ratio of those cars had to be high (becaue much of the raw material for buildings cars had to be imported too); hence very small cars at relatively high price, and ""sportiness"" was sold those cars.  2. Vette is a technological and engineering tour-de-force. Everything is tried to save an ounce here and an ounce there. I'm not even sure if GM makes any money on making Vette; it's the halo car for the company. On the other hand, 3 series is the main source of income for BMW. Bean-counting decisions have to be made for such a bread-and-butter car (for BMW). For example, making the body shell out of aluminum or fiber/graphite composite material instead of good old heavy steel sheet metal is simply out of question for the regular 3 series."
3711,brightness04,April 2007,"Mazda 3 sedan/wagon would make for a decent sporty car that is light (2700-2900lbs) and enough room for four. However, by the time Volvo has done building ELLS on the same platform to produce S40/V50, the car weighs 3200-3300lbs, and has squeezed out much of the sportiness. It may have something to do with what consumers demand in entry level luxury cars. Personally, I would not buy any car weighing less than 3300lbs, preferrably 3600+lbs, simply because that's the weight of an average decade-old Jeep Cherokee that a lot of high school kids learning to drive are driving. I wouldn't want to place my family in anything weighing much less than what the most accident-prone population is driving."
3712,circlew,April 2007,"KD, agreed. The Altima is out if you want real safety and real performance. It really depends on the level that you expect and the balance delivered.  The weight issue can be debated up and down the food chain regarding vehicle hierarchy. Sports cars are sports cars and ELLPS are what they are as well. If there are 4 people in say an RX-8, you can not drive at 10/10ths, agreed?  If one wants true performance in this segment at this point, the 3'er looks to me as where it's at! (IMHO) Hefty? Perhaps. Alternative? Debatable.  Regards, OW"
3713,circlew,April 2007,"I agree with your assessment regarding the minimum weight desired and defensive safety for the family. I believe this is why even today the 3'er is a notch ahead of the pack here. You get a higher level of performance with good safety at the expense of about 6 months of Big Macs under the belt!  Put another way, sub 3K lbs. (1,360 Kg.) in Europe was OK when most cars were predominantly under that anyway. Even there the cars are plumping up so pure sports setups are more custom than what you can get stock as was more prevalent in the past.  I say we draft a law that allows teenyboppers to only drive Smart Cars until they hit, say, 30!! You can't hurt a squirrel with one of those!  Regards, OW"
3714,blueguydotcom,April 2007,"The Altima is out if you want real safety and real performance. It really depends on the level that you expect and the balance delivered.  That's total supposition.  You guys are really hung up on archaic notions of safety. Weight does not = safety. Talk about 1970s thinking. Race cars prove time and again that you can have a supremely light vehicle that provides insane levels of protection (200+ mph into concrete walls).  Weight = enemy of fun,. Weight does not = safety.  I'd much rather be in a head-on accident in an e46 3 series than a 1969 Caprice Classic. Yet the ole Caprice outweighs the 3 series by probably 1k lbs."
3715,circlew,April 2007,"I agree weight does not = safety. Strength and engineering matter way more. I'd rater be in my e90 than an e46 or the Altima in a head-on. Better engineering DESPITE the added weight is all I am saying.  Agree on the fun = less weight.  Regards, OW"
3716,ggesq,April 2007,"For kicks, I went to the NHTSA site to compare a FWD TL to a RWD 3er and both had the same exact rollover, static stability and dynamic test results."
3717,circlew,April 2007,"I was wondering about the other 2007 ELLPS candidates safety ratings. I checked the others and they were all 4 - 5 Star rating except the G35 and IS250/350 which were not rated for 2006 or 2007.  The 2007 Altima, by the way, rated one of the highest ratings against these cars in all the rated categories. The 3.5 SE sedan weighs in @ 3,294 lbs. vs. 3,340 lbs. for the 328 sedan, both manual.  So, both of these 2 cars are safe but are a little hefty if you want maximum sporting. The trick will be to reduce 300 lbs off the weight and maintain the excellent crash data.  BGDC, perhaps I spoke to soon. Here is your E36 head-on result with a truck @ 60 MPH...4 passengers, no one seriously injured.      Regards, OW"
3718,texases,April 2007,"You need to post these over on the ""project cars"" :P"
3719,mariner7,April 2007,"brightness, it's unfair to compare Vette with any of the Bimmers. Any Bimmer has lots of natural rivals. If it skims on creature comforts, it'll lose sales to MB or any number of makes. Most Bimmers are everyday car, their owners expect all the things that go with that.  Vette is an icon, sort of w/o natural rivals. I guess the car closest in iconic status is 911. GM has a lot more leeway in designing Vette, because of lack of natural rivals. Plus Vette is a toy, not everyday car, to many of its owners, so they don't mind if it lacks many creature comforts, or if the suspension is real uncomfy!  Now that new M3 has a V8, I wouldn't bet on the Vette when the 2 meet on a race course."
3720,brightness04,April 2007,"I totally agree with you on the general sentiment. Lately, however, something very weird is going on. It's as if some of the luxury brands are caught up in some kind of discount selling frenzy. CTS can indeed be had for $299 with no money down (big surprise to me too), and 328i local lease (no ED) is being advertized for $129/mo with $5500 down (which works out to be $360-370/mo or so with no money down). It's getting to the point where ED may not be worth the time unless one is picking up a loaded 335i or higher. For example, one of my local dealers is http://www.herbchambers.com where they are showing both deals mentioned above.  It's getting a little out of hand. Perhaps the luxury brands expanded their capacity so much in the past few boom years that they are now having to sell at marginal cost (i.e. at a price point that does not help defraying R&D cost) just to keep the factories going. That's typical of industries that are heavy on capital investment and low on marginal cost; the classic example being the airlines . . . every producer/supplier can lose a boat load of money very quickly in a price war in an industry like that."
3721,habitat1,April 2007,"For less than half the price of an Ariel Atom you can get a high performance motorcycle that will blow it's doors off and be just about as practical to drive.

3722,plekto,April 2007,"Well, I didn't say it was practical. But It's as fast as a n Enzo and according to Top Gear, faster around their test track than a CBR600 sportbike by a tiny bit. I'd love a coupe version with a new more amenities here in the U.S.(so it would be street legal)  My reaction to the silly lease rates is... who cares? $299 a month with zero down is a steal on a CTS. Drive it and save up for the big toy. This is simmialr to Ford's 0% financing fiasco last year. Don't question it - just smile and let them lose money on the deal. (kind of hoping they do it again, but probably not likely)  edit: Or, get something like a Celica used for about $8K, drive it for three years, and sell it for $5-6K."
3723,brightness04,April 2007,"just smile and let them lose money on the deal.  Yup, that's a right attitude. There's a third way: take the deal, and short their stocks, too! And let the profit from the short pay for the lease! I did that with GM/Saab in the first three years of the millenium. Too bad I don't trade ADR's like BMW because I don't want to deal with the exchange risk when the dollar is dropping like a rock."

But, Acura had less torque and HP and had a worse pounds/HP ratio. Acura was at a disadvantage on power. Perhaps Acura had better lap times because of better suspension setup.  R&T said that: ""Drive the Acura at about 7/10ths and you'll hardly realize that the front tires are providing the thrust. The overall handling balance is surprisingly neutral with understeer noticable only through tight corners"". Also, ""Turn-in response is crisp and body roll is minimal"".

3745,edwardsf,April 2007,"Eggsactly. The A4's backseat is (reputedly) very small. As I mentioned, I never get back there myself and have very few passengers (I am a single guy). I am 6-2 and have a long torso and I fit in the A4 better than any ELLP. While the TL and the G35's entire cabins seem bigger, they balance the space between front and back, thus leaving the front smaller than the A4. Also, because of the rakish front windshield design of the TL and G35, instead of looking out the window, I am looking at the visor. The IS and TSX have the least leg/head/nose room of all and the Bimmer is in between. But the Bimmer, even more than any other ELLP, seems to be built for a small person. I fit okay in the 3 series, as it is designed very well, but everything is close to me and I feel too snug.  A couple of other advantages of the A4. Quattro is better and more affordable than AWD on other ELLPs. The A4 has the best gas mileage of the group, although the 328 and the TL are close. (The G35 is awful). I am going to be ordering an Avant (an ELLPWAG?) and only the thousands more 3 series has a wagon. I am replacing a Saab 900S with its cavernous hatch and the only other similar vehicle is a Mazda6 hatch. SUVs while often having headroom, are obnosious climate changers in my view so I won't consider them."

3748,cdnpinhead,April 2007,"Bingo!  This, by the way, is why the 3 is at the top of my list. I gave the TL a shot because #7, even though it's last, is certainly nice to have. How many miles does your car have on it? Did you buy it new?  If you're leasing, #7 becomes almost irrelevant. The only factor then is the PITA involved with dropping off & picking up the vehicle as it endures repeated warranty maintenance ""issues."" Oh, and whether the dealer supplies loaner vehicles."
3749,cdnpinhead,April 2007,"Interesting input. Thanks.  I also spend 99.5% of the time in my car solo, and vastly prefer a vehicle that recognizes that preference.  Sadly, many people evaluate rear-seat room with the front seat moved as far back as possible, regardless of whether anyone in the family would actually put it there. I currently drive a car that I would defy anyone to fit into with the front seat moved all the way forward. It doesn't go so far back as I would prefer, but when it is all the way back (that would be 100% of the time), the nonexistant person behind me has plenty of leg room.  I developed a Jones for Audi 5 or so years ago, after driving several rentals in Europe. Your post helps keep it alive. If I opt to trade RWD for other factors, Audi is right in there."

3752,edwardsf,April 2007,"Grrr. The X3looks like the perfect vehicle for me but it is indeed an SUV and gets pretty poor gas mileage. This gets my goat, because the X3 is based on the 3 Series, which gets good gas mileage. Why car makers can't make a high clearance sport wagon with good mileage, I don't know. The Mazda CX(?), Legacy XT, the RDX and the X3 are really what I want but I require 25 mpg, not 20. This is for emissions reasons, not cost. I only drive around 7000 miles a year and use the car for road and camping trips, not commuting.  SUVs are allowed higher emissions per mile, so the pollution is not just correlated with the gas mileage. The only SUV I would consider is the Escape Hybrid but it is the four letter f word: F-O-R-D."

3768,markcincinnati,April 2007,"Simply put, you are a purist. I guess I am now the ""used to be"" in that regard, at least insofar as transmissions are concerned.  I know you probably have researched this, but your list (and it is YOUR list) seems to have one assumption that my buddies who sell cars for a living (here in Cincinnati, to set the stage) don't agree with. They claim that all cars, from a practical standpoint, lose value; but, they claim it is more difficult to move a USED manual transmission car, and that given two [in this case BMW's] similar cars, the USED AWD car will command a higher resale price.  Perhaps this is only applicable above a certain climate line. In any case, it is your money.  If you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission German car these days? Even closer to impossible to find an American car with a stick, ditto a Japanese make?  My argument, for some time, always was that it was darn near a conspiracy for if people only drove (as in test drove) sticks that they would find they are more enjoyable.  These days, despite Consumer Reports claim as to the poor reliability of Mercedes, the dropping reliability of BMW's and the slight rise of Audis in that regard, I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. Some of them exact little if any penalty on mileage. Some, likewise exact no or virtually no acceleration penalty; and the argument I decided to stop fighting seemed to have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these cars.  I am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and I'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or AWD didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?  Just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of AWD was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? Or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.  Frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2WD car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in ONLY on AWD versions.  The fact, apparently, that the new CTS can be had with AWD but not AWD plus a manual transmission is a bit of a downer, but if the car is sweeet, I'd probably overlook that. Finding a 335xi or 535xi stick shift to test drive will be darn near impossible -- so if the magic lease genie makes me a deal I can't refuse, I might be forced to order a car I can't test drive and take the chance (small though it would be) that the stick shift is unsatisfactory.  Drive it like you live. :shades:"
3769,fedlawman,April 2007,"Mark, consider that BlueGuy lives in San Diego - pretty tough to justify an AWD sedan down there.  I happen to agree with both of you in that, AWD is a value adder in many markets that see inclement weather, or in the case of Audi, it does mitigate some of the negative FWD handling characteristics on their heavier, softer cars. On the other hand, I haven't driven an A3 with Sport Package, but I suspect it's pretty tight and light on it's feet, and I could see the added weight and driveline friction of AWD being a negative there.  Finally, I wouldn't say that anyone shopping/owning a car in this segment is a ""purist."" These cars, by their very nature, are unpure thanks to their luxury, soundproofing, weight, and power-assisted everything. A purist would drive an RX-8 or Evo IX before choosing one of these leviathans.  I think some people want to try to stay on the ""purer"" end of the scale and would prefer a FWD A3 2.0T to an AWD A3 3.2 Quattro - others feel the opposite but both are valid. If I still lived in Southern California, I don't think I could justify buying a 3660# A3 Quattro when there's another, identical looking A3 on the lot that is 400 lbs lighter, is more fun to drive, and costs thousands less.  There is a huge market for AWD sedans out there, but they still aren't for all people and all markets."
3770,blueguydotcom,April 2007,"they claim it is more difficult to move a USED manual transmission car,  Key words: they - salespeople - claim it. I've sold many manual cars. Recently when I put my 330i manual on swapalease I had 9 people contact me to take over the lease (over 50 people contacted me with questions). It was a deluge of people and in every case they mentioned the manual transmission. Kd and others who have sold bimmers privately can attest to the drawing power of the manual. Never owned an automatic car and I always seem to sell my cars quickly; this is probably because I'm getting manuals in fun-to-drive vehicles; my cars attract enthusiasts.  and that given two [in this case BMW's] similar cars, the USED AWD car will command a higher resale price.  It cost more to begin with, so naturally it will command a higher resale value. Navi will also increase the used car price; but never forget it added tremendously to the purchase price. $2100 navi = 2262 cost to the first buyer. in CA. Sell the car and get 1600 more because it had navi, well you just lost $600. Was it worth it?  If you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission German car these days?  Haven't had any problems. But then again, I either order my cars or buy versions intended for enthusiast's. My 03 330i 6MT was bought off the lot. Bro-in-law's 03 325 was a manual too - off the lot. 06 330i was ordered. 07 cooper s was off-the-lot with a manual.  I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable.  If you mean needing or repair at 120k instead of 80k, maybe. It's still extremely expensive to fix an auto tranny and getting pricier all the time. There is no sense in paying 1200 extra for something that could end up with a 4-5-6k bill later. The manual comes in the base price and at most it'll require a new clutch at 100-150k miles.  have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these cars.  No liquids allowed in the car, nothing to fiddle with (no cds, no navi) and phone is on bluetooth. I drive in LA with manuals; it's not a big deal. Like the unreliability of a BMW, I'll gladly take 85 % moments of unhappiness for 15% of bliss.  I am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and I'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or AWD didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?  How could AWD be lighter? It has more parts. How could it not impact fuel economy? It has more parts creating drag. how could AWD be cheaper to maintain? It has more parts. Replace AWD with automatic and you get the same thing.  Just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of AWD was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? Or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.  Manual repairs can't be higher, so the hypothetical has a logical fallacy.  Frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2WD car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in ONLY on AWD versions.  To each his own.

3776,plekto,April 2007,"These days, despite Consumer Reports claim as to the poor reliability of Mercedes, the dropping reliability of BMW's and the slight rise of Audis in that regard, I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. ****  If you look at the reliability for Mercedes in Europe, you see that they aren't considered unreliable at all - far from it, in fact. So, what gives?  - Europe uses the smaller engines and turbo diesels. These are bulletproof designs and work well. The bloated versions we get in the U.S. are only a little faster but are half as reliable.  - Europe uses 90%+ manuals. The automatics are made 110% for rental fleets for tourists and the like. As such, they are whatever cheap *chrysler* junk they can fit in them - simmilar to how much GM's rental trim cars stink compared to their non-rental units like a Lucerne CXS.  So the easy way to solve it is to get the Euro engine and the Euro trans. Case in point - the Mercedes C230K. If you bought it with manual and the 1.8L supercharged engine, it was a beautiful car. Reliable, cheap enough to fix, good handling(being 100lbs lighter up front than the 2.4 or 3.2 engine), and nearly 35mpg.  This also works with imports. Almost all of Japan also drives manuals. So manuals in imports tend to be quite decent. The mega-speed automatic in a Camry? 3500-4000 to fix. Egads, that's an astounding repair bill. In fact, the market for a used car with automatic with anywhere over 70-80K on it is miserable because the cost of a new transmission has to be factored in in the next year or two.  I never had a problem selling any car with manual. The fact is that the number of people who want manuals is always the same as it has been - about 30%. But with so few choices, most of them settle for auto-manuals or automatics. So there is a huge pent-up demand for anything the least bit sporty or luxurious with stick.  Try to get a price on a Porsche 928 or 968 with stick - gosh - it's 2K more than the automatics, easily - and you better buy it this HOUR becaue it'll be gone by tommorrow. A RX-8? The automatics rot on the lot because everyone wants stick. Mazda is getting smarter, though, and offering about 30-40% manuals in most of its sportier cars.  The local Mercedes dealer when I was last there, told me that they love getting manuals because all they have to do is put it up on autotrader and it's sold in a day or two, every time."

3778,edwardsf,April 2007,"Fed - I drove an A3 2.0T AT FWD and then an A4 2.0T AT Quattro for an hour each, back to back on empty country roads. The A3 was more exhilarating to drive. Its lower weight made it much more nimble and fast. But boy was I glad to get in the Quattro as I was b>exhausted from battling the A3's torque steer. If I could have two cars, the FWD A3 would be certainly be an option for 2 hour country drives, although I think I would instead get a Mini or a TR6 or a 2002 (1972, of course!).  As I said, I loved my light nimble 1972 Ford Capri. But I am also used to torque steer - I have had 2 Saab Turbos! And the A3 is a similar concept of the Capri but drains one like the Saab. The A3 has huge torque in a little FWD car - which equates with lots of tiring fun IF you drive hard ( I am going 60 on very windy roads in this test). But for my only car that I am driving 3-4 hours after a grueling mountain bike ride or a 13 mile hike, the A3 would be exhausting. The A4, though less nimble and connected to the road effortlessly pulls one out of corners making it easier to actually enjoy the whole driving experience (e.g. drive really fast).  BTW, I am a big guy and the A3 is cramped, just like the 3 series, the IS, the TL, and the G35. If I were not 6-2, 190, I would be more comfortable contemplating 6 hour road trips in an A3."
3779,fedlawman,April 2007,"I hear you Edward. Put in other words, AWD makes sport driving easier and more enjoyable for you because it takes some of the negative ""work"" (understeer, torque steer, etc.) out of it.  I don't have a lot of time behind the wheel of AWD sports cars, but I've participated in plenty of DE's with Evo's and STi's on the track, and they are FAST - so fast that my M3 can't keep up with them. Speaking to owners though, I've also heard that they are ""too easy"" to drive, and not much fun.  A FWD sport sedan can be very fun and satisfying once you figure out the ""magic"" of driving them properly - brake later on corner entry, trail brake deeper into the corner, turn sharper to a later apex, and straighten the wheel for track out sooner so you can get on the gas. It's a different line than conventional RWD, but once you master it, it can be just as quick as a ""RWD line"" - though I admit, it's not as much fun.  I suspect the A4 Quattro gives the driver a very planted and confidence inspiring feeling - and it feels good to push a car hard and get that unflappable ""is that all you've got?"" response. I hear where you're coming from, but for me (and a few others here, I enjoy having limits that are attainable (and exceedable). I want to get sideways, have a ""dialogue with the pavement through the tires, and be able to control/induce understeer, 4-wheel drift, and oversteer with gentle finessing of the throttle and steering wheel.

Oh, yeah - they sell extended warranties! And the more people think that they need an extended warranty, the more money they make . . .  In any case, you're missing the point. It seems that a few people on this board are under the impression that typical automatic transmissions are destined to give up the ghost when the car has relatively few miles. Maybe that's true, in which case it should be trivially easy for you, or anyone else, to supply some objective evidence supporting that position.

3792,cdnpinhead,April 2007,"""If you never have to repair your transmission, it really doesn't matter how much it costs, now does it?""  No, it certainly doesn't.  But, if you have to repair/replace/completely rebuild three of them (one required two visits, go figure) in 18 months, it will definitely give you a point of departure for future vehicle/transmission preferances & purchases.  If every (or even most of the) automatic transmission I've ever had the misfortune to deal with had been half as trouble-free as all the manuals I've enjoyed, I wouldn't be nearly as hard-over as I am today. I will NEVER own another car (that I drive myself every day -- she who must be obeyed has other ideas) with an automatic transmission.  Bring me my equivalent on the other side -- someone who suffered four major repairs on three manual transmissions in the extended family over 18 months. Oh, and those repairs need to have cost ~2-3X what the equivalent would have on the automatic.  I'm anxiously awaiting your response."

Personally, based on my experience, I've seen many MT blow outs mostly from heavy abuse but the cost was always lower to repair on average cars than AT. That was then.  My uncle owned an Automatic Transmission shop in Brooklyn for 40 years. The average cost for AT repair was ALWAYS more expensive than MT because of the complex gears and valves than needed repair (He rebuilt almost every one).  I assume a G35 or 335 MT would cost a bundle to replace but the AT would be more, that's all.

3807,habitat1,May 2007,"""Well, I think I will, because if I ever win this State lottery, a Porsche dealer will see me within the next week.""  That's what I thought about 15 years ago. But fortunately, I neither wasted my money on lottery tickets, nor on buying and trading ELLPS's every 3-4 years.  I'm NOT suggesting to anyone that they run to the Porsche dealership and cross shop a 911 with a 335i or IS350. However, consider what your money bought you 15 years ago in 1992 (base MSRP's):  $16,865 - Honda Accord LX $19,995 - Nissan Maxima GXE $23,275 - BMW 318i $24,340 - Acura Vigor $25,385 - Infiniti M30  $67,750 - Porsche C2 Coupe $76,750 - Porsche C2 Cabriolet $86,780 - Porsche C4 Cabriolet  As you can see, even a base 911 in 1992 ran 3 times the price of a base 3 series. Back then $25,000 was a heck of a lot to spend for a sedan.  Now, 15 years later, in this ELLPS forum, we are all discussing ""entry level"" cars in the $35k to $50k range. A well equiped 335i runs twice what a 318i ran in 1992. Arguably, the 335i is twice the car of a 318i, but the dollars have still doubled. Except for Porsche. The base C2 Coupe runs $72,800, a mere $5k and 7% more than in 1992. Not to mention that, now, Porsche dealers will even discount. They didn't have a German word for that concept in 1992. My dealer recently sold a reasonably optioned, brand new 911 C2 for $69,000.  Like I said, I'm NOT advocating the 911 as a potential replacement for the family sedan. But relative prices have changed a lot. It wasn't that long ago (1994) when I bought a 1995 Maxima SE for $21,000 and nearly had an anxiety attack trying to justify to myself the extra $3,000 it cost over a 4-cylinder Altima GXE. Now $3,000 is barely the cost of a navigation system or Mark Levison sound system.  Want a Porsche 911 in a decade? Buy a Honda Accord now and keep it for 10 years. Put the difference that you would have spent in your ""future fun account"". No lottery tickets needed."

3818,qbrozen,May 2007,"actually, its not all that far fetched. Depends on how you do the calculations. I've found plenty of 4-year-old Boxsters with average miles in the mid-$20s pricerange. So if you compare to MSRP of an accord, you could feasibly find a 3-year-old boxster for that money.  Of course, the reality is an accord can be bought for far under msrp. So i think the buying price of a 4-year-old boxster would be about the equivalent.  I could post about a dozen examples, but here's just a few: '03 with 40k miles '03 with 50k miles '03 with 47k miles"

Hint: these are not the equivalence to the 911 or even the Boxster. :P  However, I do agree with you 150% that this comparo has BS written all over it. How can the car wins in all categories loss a head-to-head comparison? MT can spin it anyway they want but this one will be too hard to justify.

I gotta say, however, I am impressed they got the G37 automatic to hit 60 mph in 5.4 secs. That's pretty darned good. And considering most other test I've seen of the 335 auto have it hitting 60 in under 5 secs, maybe it was a slow track day and the G37 is even better than the 5.4 would indicate.

Of course it might look better in person and of course how it actually drives is very important. It looks like there is no room in the back seats so maybe it's a 2+2? The price point is really going to matter with this car. The MINI isn't available in most places like BMW's so if they price it well over a MINI which for me is going to be about 100 miles away, service would be a big problem. So no MINI for me. This has possibilities but not if they overprice it. I think they need to base the 135i at about $27K. Much higher and you start competing with all kinds of cars."

Not always, MSRP is a figure the car manufacturer determines the car *should* retail for. It's a given number that in the real world has little meaning due to rebates and discounts and haggling and leasing and trade-ins etc.... But MSRP is set by the manufacturer, not the dealer.

But my marketing director's former 2002 E300 Turbodiesel felt like a true luxury car - quiet, solid, nice interior. Her assistant's C240 was, IMO, noisy, less solid feeling and a downscale interior by comparison. I do not think of the C class as a ""luxury car"".  Whatever your decision, I would not put much value in 36k miles vs. 24k. I would actually rather buy a car that has been driven regularly, with a good mix of highway miles, than one only used for short hops. I have 155k mostly highway miles on my 13 year old Nissan Maxima and it has less mechanical wear and tear than cars with 1/3 that mileage driven mostly in the city."

The wife hates the wood, but I'd rather not fry in the summer."
3847,qbrozen,July 2007,"In my experience, yes it does."
3848,pv2,July 2007,I think a bigger factor in heat is the black interior; not the aluminum trim. My prior car was a 2003 CL-S with black interior and there's a noticeable improvement with the lighter interior on my 2007 TL-S. No noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim. You might want to try a front window shade if it's parked in the sun.
3849,qbrozen,July 2007,"No noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim.  i believe carbon fiber is not known for retaining heat, however, and is the silver trim you speak of aluminum or painted plastic?  The only car I really had a problem in was my 350Z. The aluminum shift knob was barely usable on a real hot day if the sun had been beating on it.  You are right, of course, that a sunshade can help. But the aluminum will not absorb any less of the sun's rays in a light-colored interior."
3850,texases,July 2007,"Like you say, most 'aluminum' trim is painted/plated/whatever plastic, so no difference there, but a solid metal gear shift knob will fry you (had one many years ago). You could take an appropriately-sized foam coffee cup to slip over it to keep the sun off, but it would still heat up. The problem with metal is not that it gets hotter (everthing inside will get to about the same temperature, except for what's in the sun) but that it conducts heat so well, so it can deliver all that heat rapidly to your hand, unlike plastic. So the black interior will be the bigger factor. Go to the max on legal, high-quality window tint for the side and rear windows (I wouldn't do the front) if you don't mind the reduced night vision, and get a good removeable widow shade."
3851,blueguydotcom,July 2007,Many cars with aluminum trim (BMWs and Cooper S - so yes it's real aloo-mini-um) and I've never noticed them as hot to the touch.
3852,tayl0rd,July 2007,"Real aluminum doesn't retain heat, it repels it. [ok. Repel was the wrong choice of words.] That's why aluminum is used as heat shields on cars, etc. I have a car that has real aluminum trim and it [the trim] is never hot to the touch. It maintains a relatively constant temperature in hot or cold. With direct contact, heat will pass right through aluminum; with indirect contact, it just bounces off.  I usually will pull aluminum foil straight out of a hot oven with my bare hands because it doesn't hold the heat of the oven. As long as you don't grab it where the hot food or cooking pan is, you're fine."
3853,scottm123,July 2007,"Aluminum does not repel heat. The fact is that Aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat.  What this means is that if Aluminum is placed near a heat source, it heats very quickly and holds its heat. Once the heat source is removed, it cools quickly as well.  The reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because, as you open the oven door, the heat source is removed (hot air leaving oven) and replaced with cooler air. You can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area. If aluminum repelled heat, aluminum oven bags would not work.  Aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant, like a very hot interior, caused by the sun. Once the interior cools, the aluminum should cool as well, as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well."
3854,gordonwd,July 2007,"I currently have a '04 325i and before that had a '98 A4, both excellent cars IMHO. My wife is now shopping for a car and wants something no larger than mine, and preferably a bit smaller but practical. What we are seriously looking at is the Audi A3, which is quite nice with the 2.0T and DSG tranny.  I had some hope for the 1-series, but was surprised that they're just bringing it in as a coupe. For us, a car that size is not very practical unless it has the extra space that you get with the hatch style. So the 1 is out and the A3 might be in for us, but we're also waiting to see what they do with the Opel Astra when it comes here later this year with a Saturn badge on it."
3855,blueguydotcom,July 2007,We've got an 06 A3 with DSG. It's a great car and we're extremely happy with it so far.
3856,dan12,July 2007,"I'm looking at a new BMW 3-series sedan with the aluminum trim. I have no idea if it's covered with plastic or anything else. It sure doesn't look like it is. But there is a bunch of it, both on the dash and next to the gear shift. I hope BMW is smart enough not to plaster a car with material that will fry you, especially right next to the gear shift where you are likely to put your hands.  Anyone have experience with the 3-series specifically?"
3857,blueguydotcom,July 2007,"Yes, my 2006 330i had aluminum trim. Never got hot to the touch. And it was the real deal. The lame gearshift does not have aluminum."
3858,kdshapiro,July 2007,Congratulations...hope you continue to enjoy it.
3859,blueguydotcom,July 2007,"It's the fiancee's car but yes we dig it. It's a nice shift from the Cooper S - quieter, roomier, softer, and obviously able to swallow more stuff."
3860,blueguydotcom,July 2007,"'ll wrap it up by saying this: - Lexus for Luxury and peace of mind quality - BMW for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it - Audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best price  So basically, if you want a Toyota with a nicer badge and no back seat, get the IS.  Of course a TSX or Camry V6 would offer all the same for a much lower price and give you a backseat. So really, if driving performance isn't important, why bother with an IS250?"
3861,jzalkin,July 2007,"I hope to not get into a pissing match so let me clarify.  ""if you want a Toyota with a nicer badge and no back seat, get the IS"" Please share the Toyota that Lexus just put the IS badge on to make a Lexus? The Lexus IS is based on the Lexus GS platform so it is not a glorified Toyota as you implied.  The Lexus is more Luxurouis IMO (and most other including car mags) than the BMW. Just touch the inside of the A pillar to see what I mean. The BMW is better at handling which does me little good in South Florida since there are no winding roads (grid system)or even any hills. A perfect place for raw, straight line performance (my old Ford Cobra was a lot of fun).  The BMW costs more for similar equipment and has a worse reliability record. Thus, there is a premium price to be paid for the logo compared to Lexus,Infiniti, Audi for similar equipment. I would say the same for Mercedes as well.  If he had mentioned the TSX, I would summed it up as the best value, but without the style or Luxury as some of the others.  For me the IS250 is perfect since it offers Luxury, quality, reliability, style (subjective), and gas efficiency. For me the BMW offored less luxury, less reliability, better handling, so-so styling (sedan - subjective), run-flats (I consider a negative) and increased cost.  BTW - The 3 series back seat is small (slightly larger than the IS) and not ideal for frequent adult use either. For that the 5, CTS, GS is ideal.  PS - Equipping the 328 as my Lexus Edmunds shows MSRP to be $40,300 with invoice of $37,120. I paid $500 over invoice (+TTL) for my Lexus at $32,500. Is the BMW worth $5,000 more - that is question only the person buying can answer."
3862,louiswei,July 2007,Pss...  Don't know if you are new or what but I'll let you into a little secret...  This board is anti-Lexus.  Don't share this with other people okay?  :P  PS. it's a joke (well...sort of)
3863,dontbuylexus,July 2007,"I do agree that there are people who put a logo factor on the BMW, which is weird to me, but I would hardly say that the Lexus offers peace of mind. I have had nothing but problems with mine. Things were much better with my 330i. It had the same performance but it was totally better quality. For the entire 3 years I had the 330i, I only had the sunroof stick, they regreased it and it was fine. for the 18 months I have had my IS250, there have been countles problems, and they fight me on them. BMW always said ""i'll be right back"" and then it was fixed. Lexus finds a way to try to blame me for it. The Audi, I no noting about.  My friend put it to me this way, cars are mostly computerized now a days, so would I want a computer made in Germany or made in Japan. I chose the latter but what I didn't account for is that all the mechanical items on the IS250 are cheap and made to be replaced frequently. Lexus sees that as big $$$$ for the American market. BMW still believes in making a quality product out of pride which will last. and they make a decent amount (enough and to not gouge) for it."
3864,dontbuylexus,July 2007,"Sorry to ruffle your feathers, but it's not a war buddy. It is a disussion. You actually came into a curent Lexus discussion to try to smear me because I don't like my lexus experience and was helping a person who was asking for help.  Geez it's like those old movies with high school gangs (ie the jets and something else).  Louis, Its ok, no one is attacking you personally. Why are you so scared that people will say bad things about your IS250 that you have to send ""secret"" messages and crash an ongoing discussion about the cost of owning an IS250 to a new buyer?  Relax, no one is here to hurt you. But on the same note I would say if you don't like the bad with the good statments, then why are you here?"

I would've been better off getting the Accord than the IS250. Maybe it goes a little slower and doesn't have those neet little buttons that open my garage, but at least I would know that I would be taken care of by Honda Corporate attitude.  BTW, everyone knows that the rags are rigged to say what the auto makers want them to. Only the internet is true when it comes to facts. (ie asking actual owners)."
3867,dontbuylexus,July 2007,Do I care about your overly dramatic comments?
3868,louiswei,July 2007,"You actually came into a curent Lexus discussion to try to smear me  I came to the Lexus discussion not because of you it's because I tracked all IS related discussions. Don't be too full of yourself.  helping a person who was asking for help.  Honestly, the reason I reply is because I don't think your posts are so helpful but rather than you are using them for your own agenda. As a current IS owner and many others, we have different dealership experience than you do.  Why are you so scared that people will say bad things about your IS250 that you have to send ""secret"" messages and crash an ongoing discussion about the cost of owning an IS250 to a new buyer?  First of all, I am not scared. Second, I don't have an IS250 and last but not least, if you can't take the previous ""secret"" post as a joke then I have nothing to add here. Dude, I have been here (ELLPS board) way longer than you do and there is a reason for my previous joke. I am pretty sure habitat1 gets it... :P  Oh, by the way, the previous discussion wasn't about ""the cost of owning an IS250"" like you stated. It's about a comparison between the IS, 3er and A4. You, my friend, made it a cost discussion in order to pursuit your own agenda.  Relax, no one is here to hurt you. But on the same note I would say if you don't like the bad with the good statments, then why are you here?  LOL, like you are capable of hurting me. Dude, you are way too full of yourself. As for bad and good statements...my philosophy is always: Give credit when credit is due."
3869,jzalkin,July 2007,"Every car maker has it's bad examples. dontbuylexus has one.  It comes down to Odds. Odds are that Lexus will build a better car and JD Power proves it as well as CR. There are good dealers and bad as well for all makers.  According to Edmunds: Lexus IS250 5 year maintenance cost: $4,305 1$364 2$839 3$554 4$1,527 5$1,021 Total:$4,305 BMW 328 5 year maintenance cost: $3,098 1$0 2$0 3$0 4$1,009 5$2,089 Total$3,098  So that means that BMW costs more to maintain (compare year 4 & 5), but gives you some freebees. Savings will vary on miles driven and length of ownership. I drive 24,000 miles/year so I take the longer view. Drove out of my free Audi service in less than 2 years.  If I could get the BMW at $500 over invoice like my Lexus; I would still be ahead $4,000 +/- over 5 years (less for me due to mileage) with the Lexus. The BMW would also have a bigger chance of failing.  Not all Lexus are perfect and not all BMW will fall apart. It is just the odds that the Lexus will be more reliable (and cost less) than BMW.  Sorry for your bad experience, but it does mean that I now have a mathematically better chance that mine is perfect since yours is not. A weird way to look at it, but mathematically true."
3870,dontbuylexus,July 2007,"I agree about the bad and good experiences and that there are lemons with every mfr.  The point I was making was beyond the dealer. Meaning if neither the BMW or Lexus dealers could help you and you have to escalate it. BMW prides itself on taking care of their customers and Lexus is only about building the hype of quality and service. I've experienced both and i'v talked to others who feel the same.  If nothing goes wrong The IS250 is a great car, but if something does, be prepared to fight Lexus on it and in a big way.  BTW, as I stated the Mags' facts are never true, JD and CR dont have their facts straight on maint cost. and maint should be per mile and not per year for better acuracy.  Here is the true cost from my dealer and all So Cal dealers charge the same:"
3871,kdshapiro,July 2007,"""It comes down to Odds. Odds are that Lexus will build a better car and JD Power proves it as well as CR.""  Let me ask you, do you feel better knowing you have a lemon from a high quality auto manufacturer? Meaning your the odd man out who has the car that is the POS?  To me it doesn't make a difference about odds. A lemon is a lemon, even from a manufacturer at the bottom of the barrel.  That is why I don't make my final decision on reliability surveys."
3872,blueguydotcom,July 2007,"The Lexus IS is based on the Lexus GS platform so it is not a glorified Toyota as you implied.  Ah, no my point was: you don't care about handling, so why bother with a RWD car? you do care about luxury, quality and space (mentioned the backseat is small). A Toyota Camry, Hyundai Acara, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and an Acura TSX offer all of those things: luxury, quality and space.  What's wrong with those choices? If the 5k difference pushed you into an IS250, then the 5k gap from a TSX/Camry to IS250 probably would make a difference too. You sure the badge didn't play a little role? Just a wee bit?"

The BMW would also have a bigger chance of failing.  You can easily buy a BMW for 5k off MSRP. Take the $1300 saved on maintenance and apply that to your flight to Germany, 1 night at the Munich Marriot ($55) and various cab transfers (you can easily fly to Germany for under $800 from Florida).  The prices come out nearly even. But you don't want the badge or the performance, so, I don't get the point of buying a RWD Lexus when a FWD Acura or Toyota would suffice."

3876,dontbuylexus,July 2007,"Good Point kd  I never trust those surveys or data from these type of sites. I would never trust data from a place who makes their profit from the advertisers who they are building the data about. I have been in advertising for 15 years and I know how it works. There is a chain where everyone scratches everyones back and the consumer is none the wiser.  Another point is the Mercedes case study. They were it, as far as number one quality in the 1990's, but they have the worst (yes I did own one too) quality of the high-line cars lately. Everyone seems to think that it is because Chrysler bought them. That is not true. Daimler (a German company who has owned MB for a long time) bought Chrysler. The reason for the decline in quality was that Dr. Dieter (CEO)(yea that guy from the ads) saw that the company had an outstanding reputation and saw where he could cut corners on quality to make more $$$. This would take several years to ripple down and most consumers buy what they are told they can trust (ie name recognition and reputation) and not on the quality of the current model itself.  Who today has an outstanding reputation built from the 1990's through to the 2000s, recently changed their body styles for the entire line and who has a new VP of the American division (Jim Farley)? Yes it's Lexus.  People will see, they will ride out their reputation and new styling (which does look good btw) until the music stops and people start seeing them as the greedy corporate rats they are. People will only notice this when they notice that their Lexus cars are not as good as they used to be. This takes a few decades to happen. Just look at GM. They were at the top once and now where are they after blowing $1b on the EV1 then bucking under pressure of the oil companies.  But it is easier for people to stick their heads in the sand and take what they are fed like good little mice.  Like kd said a POS is a POS by any other name. at least if I got an Accord, I would've saved half my money."

The'06 330xi which I drive is 3,671 lbs. I assume the 231 extra lbs. is distributed evenly across the platform. The 330i is 3,450 lbs. or about 11 lbs. heavier.  What is the real difference with this car? :confuse: 11 lbs. and a few grand less cash? Can the performance vary that much? I assume the 2002, which is the emulation here, was way lighter.

3880,dontbuylexus,July 2007,"First of all why is someone who talks about a bad situation a nut job when more people all over this forum are falling all over themselves to praise Lexus and nobody says a word about how annoying they are.  Second, The TSIB is a good thing, but a year later, while Lexus sends those who accept their lies without fixing the problem (lies here beiong that it was my driving and that the window problem was the stationa and or the tint). That is at best neglegence and at worst corporate fraud.  Third, if you go to ""my.is"" you will find a heap of postings about how the previous IS owners are underwelmed with 06/07 and that they are sick of fighting Corporate. If you go on a BMW forum and search for corporate problems (not mechanical) you wont find any because no matter how many mechaninical issues there are, BMW always fixes it and definatly never blames their customers.  Lastly, Enron and Lexus both cheated and lied for profit, is that simple enough?  I find that Lexus zealots, or eny make for that matter, are so blinded that they can't even see that they seem just a crazy as those who oppose Lexus. Maybe even more so because your blind faith is scary. At least I said that I would give BWM the boot if they acted like Lexus."
3881,blueguydotcom,July 2007,"he key is what will the company do for you when there is a problem.  And as I've pointed out, BMW failed to resolve many of my issues. And plenty of BMW owners can attest to this sort of result. A check in bimmerfest will reveal many 335i owners with sundry unresolved issues - many fuel pump related.  They would've checked into the brake issue and pulled it up on the computer, showed it to me and said ""here I see that there is a TSIB on it. would you like to leave it today or make an appiontment for us to change out the brakes for you?""  Not necessarily. Plenty of ZHP owners reported engine problems (dying, stuttering) for years without dealers acknowldege problems, looking for TSBS or in any way offering a resolution.  My trips to BMW for engine problems, electrical issues and HVAC equal over 20 in the course of 4 years of ownership.  Lexus Corporation, not the car, is evil, BWM corp is great.  Rofl. I had a 43k 330i that was marketed and sold as containing a ""performance package"" (ZHP). When BMW's ECUflashes did not resolve the issue with my engine, BMW corporate directed the dealership to disable my car's engine so that the variable valves would always remain in one position - thus no more highend power. Get how that might be frowned upon? I bought the performance package and BMW said they're going to remove the performance as a ""fix.""  No company is perfect. Lexus has a far better track record with customer satisfaction than BMW. By a longshot. I will continue to buy BMWs but I don't suffer from the delusion that BMW views me as anything but expendable.  And if you can't find people complaining about poor dealer service on a bimmer board, you're not looking very hard."

I agree that BMW has had a history of occasional system problems. I also agree that there are BMW dealers out there who suck. The important thing to see is how Lexus Corp is using it's great rep from the 1990's struggling to acheive the BMW status in the public eye, they are using that to now take advantage of thier customers by finding every excuse to save a dollar and over charging. That is corporate greed.  So I respect your opinon as that. Mine differs. This is a forum my a pissing match. That is more than I can say for those people who cant stand to read anything bad about their precious car. btw, I have found countless postings on how bad Lexus is, but that doesn't change the fact that they screw me everytime I go in there.

"" If BMW, according to you is so filled with problems that they dealers and corporate will not fix, then why do you continue to buy them? The answer is that they do fix the problems on a personal level. Anyone who complains that they are not is just not letting them get it through the system (a few months, unlike Lexus took a year and a half for the pads and still no rotors).  When I had my BMW I had some issues like shipo had with the computer which needed updating. But when I asked for help they would look into it and then fix it. Lexus tells me that it is me without even taking the car into the service rack. There is a difference between the ability to fix something (reconfigure software updates or develop a new part) to outright doing nothing on principle and then blaming customers who demand more."

The dealership brought the service manager out to look at my car. He said to me, it looked like car wash rail damage. Before he finished the sentence, he said, ""we'll replace the rim on warranty"". He ordered the rim and a week later it was installed. He didn't have to do that for a New York minute. In addition, they always voluntereed to pick up and deliver a loaner to me when I needed to bring the car in. (which wasn't very often)  As you said, the car is the car and stuff will happen.

They took it back, cleaned it, regreased it and gave it back in an hour..... $0 but for me, priceless!  They always patched tires for me free of charge too. Lexus made me buy a new, unpatchable tire (run flat) for $250. This was after I had a tire warranty and an added ""tires for life"" scam at Tustin Lexus which I paid +$1600 at signing for.  Also, when I turned in my 330i just before 60k, I had to pay $1,600 early turn in fee (about 8 mo before EOT)(I needed to move to Asia for a year for work). 2 months later my Stateside mail service emailed me and said that I had a check from BMW. It was $2,250 for the residual value after they sold it pre-owned. That, I have never heard of before. But anything can happen, It's BMW.  I agree with Brian, If Lexus floats someone's boat more power to 'em. But that doesn't give them the right to discount me telling my bad and good experiences with Lexus and BMW."

If BMW, according to you is so filled with problems that they dealers and corporate will not fix, then why do you continue to buy them? The answer is that they do fix the problems on a personal level.  No it's all about the drive, friend. I bought another VW (Audi actually) even though my only experience with VWAG was awful too. I place driving pleasure above all else. So if I spend 20-30 days without my car per year it's worth it. Unlike most people, I don't let worries of reliability color my buying decision. Life's too short for me to be stuck in a bland car missing vital elements (ala carte ordering and a manual at Lexus for instance).  Anyone who complains that they are not is just not letting them get it through the system (a few months, unlike Lexus took a year and a half for the pads and still no rotors).  3 years with an engine that stuttered. 3 years with electronics that didn't work. 1 year with a bad HVAC unit.

With all due respect, I don't think your experiences with BMW are typical, or the penalty you are willing to pay for personal priorities is necessary.  Within my social and business circles I know a large number of people that own Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and all of the other premium brands. I don't know of a single BMW owner that, in order to enjoy the ""driving pleasure"" of BMW, expects that they will need to be without their car an extra 5-10 days a year, let alone 20 or 30. These are law partners, doctors, and corporate execs that don't have the time or tolerance for such B.S. Even those that drive M5's and M3's.  Maybe 30 years ago ""driving pleasure"" meant you had to be prepared to go without your car for a month a year. And maybe that's also why Alfa Romeos, Fiats, MGs, and some of those other ""pleasurable"" brands aren't around anymore.  But it's 2007. Porsche supplanted Lexus as #1 in the IQS, And my former Honda S2000, arguably about as ""pleasurable"" as you can get for under $40k was also tops in reliability and resale. You can have your cake and eat it too, today. I sincerely hope your experience with your Audi and Mini prove you wrong and you're not without them for 20-30 days annually. Because if I wasn't willing to accept that kind of trade off on a 911, you sure as hell shouldn't have to on them. There are plenty of other good choices in their categories."

So if they ""made"" you (how can anyone make you is a whole different story) then you would have 3 non run-flats and one run-flat. Now BMW's include run-flats which many a BMW owner has complained about and spent their own money shortly after buying replacing them.  If it is true, then the dealership is the worst in the world (possible) or you are stretching the truth in order to bash Lexus even more.  PS - My dealership patched my tire after getting a slow leak. Gave me a RX loaner so I could travel to then next County and make a meeting.  People on this board has complained about persistent problems and denials by BMW that went on for years. Does their experiences count as well as yours since you stated that these forums are the only truth? Does that now make Lexus and BMW even as ""baby Enrons"" Or you only selective in determining a good and bad company? If BMW is good because your experience than Lexus is good based on mine."

You have made your point many times and now it is for others to talk about the prices they have been quoted and how the dealer treated them. The best place to reiterated your issues with Lexus so that people researching if it is the right vehicle for them is in the discussion created about maintenance costs.  If you want to write more about your dealership experiences, please do write a Dealer Rating & Review by clicking on the banner at the top of the page. Also, if you haven't done so already, please also submit a review about your vehicle at http://www.edmunds.com/apps/ratings/ratingsIndex.jsp?usein=n  The staff told you that the point was made and to give others a chance to talk without refuting everything. Even gave you the proper place to rate your dealership since that is where your problem seems to be. Now you come here and wonder why (after being told) you are being shut out.

Everything about that car is engineered to go fast and nothing else. Other than that, I think it's the best ellps out there. Everything else was too small (I tend to put a coupla shorties in the back seat about twice a week) except maybe the A4, which I liked but it's dated and I didn't want to wait for the new one so that left me one option; a pre-owned luxury performace sedan.

3952,vic10,September 2007,"Well, the Edsel was polarizing...but that wasn't necessarily a good thing....  The last Caddy I liked was the 1999. Still carried remnants of the ""classic"" Caddy look. The mushy looking 2000 was just soooo boring. There were hopes when the edge look was to come out but somehow the look was also boring, and didn't look very integrated (the 300C also has the slab sided edgy look but it comes off better...much better I think). I walk past a 2007 STS in the parking lot every morning and it's about as exciting looking as a Checker cab. Finally got to the point where I could easily afford one and suddenly found I didn't want one.  Having said that, I think the CTS (and not the STS)really benefited from the 2008 restyle. Much more interesting exterior. Really like the agressive front end. And the interior looks much more refined--though I have one issue, aside from that hugh looking steering wheel: The dual climate controls on either side of the console. So if you're solo in the car and want to change setting you have to lean around to get both sides working in parallel??"
3953,readerreader,September 2007,"I guess the Aztec is ""brilliant"" also. ==============================================  That is a non sequitur.  The success of the car will be in the sales.

So if you're solo in the car and want to change setting you have to lean around to get both sides working in parallel??  I don't think so. There's an Auto button there. Most likely, like with all the other cars I've seen, the Auto button gives the driver full control of the climate control system. The Pass button allows the passenger to control their side. Look again, you'll see that the Pass button is illuminated, not the Auto."

3958,plekto,September 2007,"The steering wheel comes in three trims. One is some sort of rubberized nonsense, then there is leather. Evidently they did the foam/rubbery thing to match the leather one in size.(some of the leather interior ones don't have a leather wrapped wheel, so they look like they cheated a bit)  There's also a thinner one on the base model. I think it looks best.  Pros: Much better car in every way inside and underneath. Cons: Sheet metal on it is hideous in person compared to the older one's exterior. Only black or a very dark color serves to make it look smaller and hide the myriad of hideous angles.(looks very sharp in black, btw). The sunroof is also a joke - it's huge but still so far back that the driver can't see OUT of it. It just creates a massive lens as it's slightly curved in the wrong direction/way. The interior really feels awful in the summer heat with that thing beating heat down on the back of your neck(right at the driver's hearrest seems to eb the focal point)  The flat aluminum rims look better than the chromed as well."

Oddly enough my last car, a Mercedes, also had this type of parking brake. Go figure.  Yes, it's nice I guess, but the brake on the GM is a simple push, push again to release type and works very well for hills if you want. Rev the engine, hit the clutch, and tap the brake to release it.(not like the rear brakes will do anything versus 300HP - you could probably go 50mph without noticing the parking brake was engaged)."

The car has always been slotted between the 3-Series and the 5-Series with the main advantage being interior room--not amenities.  They always had the STS for that.  Even the magazines grouped the old car there when reviewing it. All of them.  You cannot find a car like the CTS with all its dimensions etc., for the same price. No other exists (another story altogether)."

Cadillac has never, and still doesn't, garnish any of the same respect.

3984,markcincinnati,September 2007,"I do like the CTS, I will certainly consider one in early 2008, assuming they (GM) offer discounts and subvented leases as they have done time and again.  At the MSRP ""as I would configure"" the CTS, it is a fine car but -- other than fit and finish and its styling -- it ""seems to be as current as many of the other guys were putting out in the second half of 2004.""  For a typical second or third quarter GM discount, however, it will be attractive even to someone like me who thinks it is not exactly leading edge (although the DI engine seems very fine, indeed.)  On the issue of voice activation -- I have a current gen Audi A6. It has 82 buttons, knobs, switches, dials, gauges and/or controls (not including my phone.) I have the in-armrest mounted phone dock AND the thing has bluetooth. I rarely, due to the the in armrest cradle, activate bluetooth -- but I use the voice control for the audio, nav and telephone system -- almost literally every time I get into the car.  I consider it a safety feature.  Were a vote be presented to the voters of the US, I would, uncharacteristically, vote to ban the use of a cell phone in a car that was not entirely voice controlled (hand and eyes free.)  When I am driving, I often look at the other drivers on the road; I see the majority of them on the phone (driving with one hand and I assume one eye on the road and controls.)  Much as I want ""you"" to have the personal freedom to kill yourself by using a phone while driving (if that is your goal), I just don't want to be on the highway with you.  Much as I want (well, maybe) more knobs and buttons and dials and gizmos to be confronting me whilst I am behind the wheel, it is getting to the point that it is distracting to change the channel (and find other controls in the sea of buttons) without voice command.  My wife's 2005 BMW does not need voice command. The new CTS is populated with buttons, dials, rotary switches -- a virtual maze of controls. Just tell your car what you want it to do, or ""pull over"" -- folks don't want to pull over and voice command is becoming (or in the case of the Germans, already has become) a virtual safety option.

3987,sevenfeet0,September 2007,"Agreed. This forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. Manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this space and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into ""fanboyism"". I admit it, I have preferences with certain brands over others. But I want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the products from one brand to satisfy everyone. After all, if everyone just bought ""your favorite brand"", it would be a pretty boring place.  Regarding the two brands at issue here, Cadillac has been going down this ""Europeanism"" trend for a long time before the CTS, often with lousy results. I can remember the 1976 Seville, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and the 1997 Catera as examples. Cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their DNA for decades now, which isn't easy. Even with Bob Lutz at the helm, a former GM engine manager once told me that GM's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially Cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. Witness the 1981 V8-6-4 engine failure, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and Catera projects all made Caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.  Constrast that with BMW. The BMW we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. Originally in the shadow of Mercedes and Audi, they made their mark with great handling sedans and coupes that were contrary to what most American buyers were used to seeing. Were all these products successful? Not a chance. The 320 program of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. The 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for Bangle styling and iDrive. But the path to where BMW is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.  In business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once powerful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. Apple Computer is a classic example. Cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). What happens next? Who knows? But the marketplace will decide."

At lease for now.  I back up that view since there is no better performing car offered by GM/Chryler/Ford compared to the 3 series in the sedan class, IMO. And I will admit I always considered the E36/46 were to small for my tastes predominantly because I was used to U.S. market fare. I believed the Buy America was the way to go until it made little sense at the end of the day. I was surprised at the weight of my 330 considering the compact designation, however. I guess BMW compromised from the original design strategy. But the suspension still is to die for. I could care less for the perceived image factor. You could slice off the roundel and it would still be in my garage.  I agree it is fun to see what the ""Hurtin' Three"" will do to put the train back on the tracks. The Camaro and Challenger coming back from the dead will be interesting.  For GM, Cadillac needs a heck of a lot more work to do. Buick/Pontiac is on life support and the prognosis is NOT good.

4000,sevenfeet0,September 2007,"The 535i is the same size but is 300 lbs lighter. Shrug.  This is a poor rebuttle. My argument was that the CTS's measurements were within the parameters of the class. Weight was heavy, but still not the worst of the class.  Then what's the hangup on a barge like a 5 or CTS? Seriously you just went on and on about epa space and then come back by saying it's not important to you. So what is important? If space isn't an issue, then why opt for a car of that size?  When did I ever say that EPA space wasn't important to me? Please reread my post. I only used it to show the differentiation in the sizes of the vehicles. Everybody says the CTS is either better suited to compete against the BMW 3-series or is more of a ""tweener"" car in size. The measurements of this car say otherwise. You could successfully make that argument about the older car, but not this one.  Huh? 5 series and 3 series both have 3.0 300 hp engines compared to the Caddy's 300 hp V6. Strangely, that 300 hp 6 in the 5 and 3 propels both cars with electrifying power. What exactly is wrong with GM's engine development? The weight can't be totally to blame for the slowness of the CTS.  What I meant here was that virtually all the cars in this class (save Acura) offer both a V6 engine (sometimes two) and a V8 before getting to the ""hot-rod"" department. BMW has the 540i, Mercedes has the E550, and so on and so forth. Also, weight is a big factor in the performance of a vehicle but it's not the only factor. Available torque and where that torque is available on the RPM curve is very important. The CTS DI V6 has less torque than the 535i, and the CTS weighs more than the 535i. So noticing that the CTS is slower than the BMW isn't rocket science. Finally, gear ratios (transmission and final drive) are the third variable in the equation, but that's another discussion."

The CTS is hardly late...a five year product cycle is typical...for the record, the old car was sold for about 5.5 years.  Second, since the '08 CTS wasn't a ""clean sheet"" design, it has to deal with some of the issues of the previous car, namely the chassis. The chassis is an update to the same Sigma chassis found in the old CTS, the STS and the SRX. That chassis is known for its strength and all around performance, but it's not the lightest design out there. Some automakers are putting more and more aluminum in their chassis designs but this is expensive and have implications for repair shops. So the '08 CTS got an update on the old system, but at a cost of weight savings a new design would have brought."
4017,markcincinnati,September 2007,"The BMW turbo charged engine generates damn near weapons grade torque at damn near ""nuttin'"" RPM's.

The CTS is perhaps a 4 series or whatever might be comparable in the imaginary car world.  This makes the CTS perhaps somewhat of a bargain, since it is priced like the cars mentioned above that actually are being produced today, but is somewhat ""more"" than its price might otherwise suggest.  It seems, to me, however, to be ""state of the art"" 2004 -- and that is NOT a bad thing, especially at the price most of us will be able to lease one for.  It is a great effort, a very nice car, one that I would not kick out of bed for eating crackers -- but it is NOT a car that leads in any area, save perhaps price.  Drive a $40K G35X sport back to back with a $48K CTS AWD DI and make up your own mind.  Despite what you might conclude, if the CTS had decent bluetooth, I'd probably pick it over the G, based on what I assume the discount on the CTS will, shortly, be normal.

4049,pmc4,November 2007,"I can't see how the BMW wins that comparison. I mean, to see what the 3-Series really is, just go to Europe, where it's made. What are they in Europe? Are they luxury sedans? Sports sedans? Nope and nope; they're... You guessed it... TAXI'S! In fact, the only difference between the Euro-spec BMW and the US-spec BMW is the options list. The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.  American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.  The Cadillac and Infiniti on the other hand are purpose-built, true luxury/sport sedans that are well worth the $$$ printed on the window sticker: They're roomy, comfortable, leather-lined (the BMW uses vinyl padding-not leather. Think 1970's naugahyde sofa) cruisers with the world's most advanced powertrains and chassis'."
4050,blueguydotcom,November 2007,"pm04,  Benz actually seems to own the taxi market in Europe but I'm not sure how your taxi thing is a dig against any car. In Asia the Corolla seems to be the most common taxi car. Is that a bad thing? No, but I think you're making an argument that only holds water if you're a status buyer.  The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.  No in Germany and most of Europe the 3 series comes with a manual standard and 4 cylinder engines. Seriously, do some research. 6 cylinder non-diesel BMWs (and Benzes and Audi/VWs, etc) are pretty rare outside of the USA. The 318d and 320d are actually the more common 3 series in Europe; our 328i's 6 cylinder is considered a luxury and a waste of money; the 335 is primarily for speed junkies in europe as the 330d is the most popular 6 cylinder 3 outside the USA. Gas prices are way too expensive in Europe to opt for a standard gas-burner 6 cylinder.  American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.  Your ignorance knows no bounds, apparently. Go ahead and visit www.BMW.de ...we'll wait. Hit the 3 and then 3 Limo and Konfigurator.  Okay, so for the 318din Germany - that's a 1.8 liter diesel - the starting price is 29,950 euros. In US dollars that's a starting price of $43,966.  The 335i in Germany starts at 44,350E or $65,105 US Dollars. Go ahead and check the France, UK and Italy sites if you'd like too. In every case, the 3 series is far more expensive than it is in the USA.  Via European Delivery, any US citizen can pick up a 335i in Munich with leather, 6 speed, sport package, xenons, power memory seats, active steering lights, moonroof, comfort access, metallic paint for ~$40,000 US Dollars. I personally, would not opt for leather on another BMW (unlike my 2006 330i that I bought via European Delivery for $35,700 US Dollars), so the price of an ED 335i will run me closer to about 38.5k with the features I do want - ala carte pricing is so nice for those of us who want an exactly spec'ed car.  Sadly, an Infiniti G35 with moonroof, leather, sport package, active steering lights, memory seats and 6 speed will run me $38,865 US Dollars. Unfortunately, Infiniti forces me to get packages I don't want - namely a worthless navigation package. Still I'm sure I could negotiate 2500 off that price so we'll say $36,000 US Dollars for the Infiniti.  That's cheaper than the 335i still but not by much. Considering I must pay for maintenance on the G35, let's add $1000 to maintain the Infiniti over 4 years /50k miles. So for a $1500 savings I can opt for a car I don't really like, G35, and that doesn't objectively perform as well as a 335i, or just pay the extra $1500 and drive something I like more and that objectively performs better.  As I said before: for me with ED the pricing becomes moot and it's about picking the car I like to drive. The comparo swings wildly to the BMW's favor once you negate the pricing."
4051,shov8,November 2007,"Just a minor point on your post. You state you can get the G35 configured in a way you don't like (the navigation system), vs. the built-to-order ED 335i. The big caveat here that is not addressed is the ""ED"" part.  With ED (European Delivery) you have to physically travel to Munich and pick up the car. ED does include shipping back to the USA and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later, according to the web site). But the cost of flying to Munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isn't included. A sample trip in February 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the BMW according to bmw.com) from San Diego, CA to Munich runs around $2000 on Expedia. Then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. I'm just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip.  So that +$1500 cost for the 335i just went up to +$4000 total. True, you do get to go to Munich so that is a bonus. Of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. Still, we are trying to compare cost, so I think the trip cost should be added in.  Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks,  kc"
4052,blueguydotcom,November 2007,"With ED (European Delivery) you have to physically travel to Munich and pick up the car.  That's what ED is. Shrug. I didn't say otherwise as I clearly mentioned you have to get the car in Munich.  So that +$1500 cost for the 335i just went up to +$4000 total. True, you do get to go to Munich so that is a bonus. Of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. Still, we are trying to compare cost, so I think the trip cost should be added in.  Why? It's called a vacation. I'd be doing the flight and trip anyway so it's not relevant to the cost, IMHO. Hell, we just spent two weeks in Thailand and had I bought some major ticket item at that moment I wouldn't consider the flight as a cost as I'd be there on vacation anyway. Should I opt for another BMW, I'm fairly sure we'll make a vacation of it as we have friends living in Paris and London. In fact just last night we began talking about a trip to France in late 08 or 09.  Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks,  Flight = $900 (of course I've got about 200k in Frequent Flyer miles now so it'd be free. Additionally, Lufthansa has a two-for-one BMW special) * Two nights at Munich Marriott - $100 (or use Starwood points for free hotel stays) Train to BMW Delivery Center = $8 euros (about $11 US) Ride to Marriott from Redelivery Center - $35 US Lufthansa Airport Shuttle from Munich Marriott to MUC - $14 US Food - ~$100 US (actually far less as food is cheap in Germany)  *This was a vacation so I just factored in my Germany costs. In actuality I drove south through Germany, Austria and Switzerland into Italy and then swung west through the South of France. I eventually drove through France and back into Switzerland, Austria and Germany. I noted my Germany costs only as over the entire trip I spent far more but that included nights on the French Riviera and seaside hotels.  FWIW, if Infiniti or some other manu had a JD delivery program (and cars worth driving) I'd take another vacation to Japan."
4053,shov8,November 2007,"Looks like about $1200 extra from your list of expenses. I think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. Not sure if the airlines like a Saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when I looked prices up on a Tues to Thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare.  I don't think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. Plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. You're talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  I guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ED pricing the 335i wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ED thing. I'm not saying that getting a 335i for <$40k even with the European trip is a bad thing, far from it, it's just that only a few probably do the ED experience (I wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ED pricing shouldn't be used as a factor in a car comparison. Thanks,  kc"
4054,blueguydotcom,November 2007,"I understand your point of view, but can't really agree with it. I'd contend a majority of people buying in the entry-lux market fits a few criteria:  1. They already have a car. 2. They spend a bit of time looking for a car 3. They have the option of waiting for an ordered car - but many choose not to wait. 4. Most are in fairly comfortable jobs that have PTO and most take some kind of vacation.  BMW's Roundel mag had an article on ED. The numbers are growing yearly and have been for decades. Still it makes up a small fraction but it's significant enough that Audi kicked in their program this year and it's a bit more generous with knick-knacky silly things like ""free hotel"" stays and such.  As for considering it for pricing: most people have the choice. Priorities I guess."

4057,blueguydotcom,November 2007,"You're also not putting miles on it and when you do sell it, you'll lose very little in depreciation. A BMW with an MSRP of 45k and that you bought for 39k will hit you pretty lightly compared to other cars (and even an off-the-lot-BMW)."
4058,shipo,November 2007,"""And don't forget you're still making monthly payments on it, while you don't have use of it, during the 8-10 weeks of shipping.

IIRC there is one payment that you don't have to make. 2) While the 8-10 week shipping time may be the case for folks on the left coast, I received my ED car in just 4 weeks when I lived in New Jersey.  Best Regards, Shipo"
4059,habitat1,November 2007,"ED as a way to save money buying a BMW comes up on a regular basis and the pros and cons are debated as if there is a ""right"" answer. There isn't.  Having two associates that purchsed BMW's in the last 2 months highlights the differences. The one that purchased via ED took his wife to Europe for a 10 day vacation. They bought a 335i convertible and had a great time enjoying the experience. The cost of the vacation was more thn offset by the savings, especially since the car was not one that is being discounted much, if at all, stateside. He paid $1,500 over ED invoice and saved $5,500+ over the US MSRP.  The other person, who previously bought a BMW in 1996 via ED considered going that route again. But given that he now has kids (3) at home and the trip could not be converted, practically or economically, into a family vacation, he decided to buy stateside. He bought an in-stock 550ia at close to invoice, and would have only saved an additional $3,000 going the ED route. He is a freelance attorney, with an hourly billing rate of around $500 and could not justify going away for 3-4 days to essentially save perhaps $1,500, after expenses.  For some, the idea of ED is a very appealing way to take advantage of a significant price break, especially on certain models. But I certainly respect that, for others, time is money and the ED savings, while not insignificant, may not meet their ""return"" requirments, given the time it takes.  I would agree with the suggestion, however, that ED should at least be explored and considered as an alternative. Almost everyone I know that has done it has had a great experience. The one exception is a friend who's (frequent flier) flight was cancelled and he went through hell and great expense rebooking to pick up the car within the required deadline. But even he admits that, once he got there, it was a worthwhile experience, albeit not much of a savings."

4062,tayl0rd,November 2007,"Just curious, why the ""have to have"" V8? ...  The effortless acceleration of a V8. I drove the 535i Sport the same day, and it just didn't cut the mustard with me. The delayed kick-down of the automatic, the seemingly slow buildup of speed/power... It just didn't feel as nice as the 550i. The 550i, to me, rides better, is quieter, and feels more planted. And at cruising speed, the sound of the V8 completely disappears. The I6 definitely makes enough fuss at speed to make it known that it's working hard for you. In a 3-series, that's tolerable. In a 5-series, at that price, it's totally unacceptable. That's why, when I was still searching, my focus was mainly on the V8 cars (A6 4.2, M45, E550, GS430, 550i.) However, the 535i was in the running because of its twin turbos and power output, but after driving it, I came back to my original requirements. I made the same mistake with the RL, only to be even more disappointed."

In fact it is so seamless in acceleration and silky smooth and quiet that I have to keep reminding myself that it isn't an ""8"".

4066,habitat1,November 2007,"I can appreciate what you are saying about the subjective feel and sound of the V8 vs. the I6, even if the I6 is now nearly as powerful and quick as the V8. I still recall my test drive of the former M5 and how impressed I was with the effortless acceleration and free revving engine. If somebody knows where I could find a new 2002 M5 that was packed in ice, I'd buy it tomorrow.  On the other hand, I wonder if you feeling regarding the I6 was tainted by saddling it with an automatic transmission? Didn't you say a manula transmisson was also a ""have to have""? I've been surprised enough by the difference in feel between the same car with a manual vs. automatic to know I would never pre-judge the manual by the automatic."

4070,tayl0rd,November 2007,"That car looks amazing! He/She definitely took fantastic care of it, for sure. But I wouldn't pay $50K for it. Being a 2003, that means it was probably sold in 2002 which means it's near 6 calendar years old. A 2003 M5 sold for, what, $75K when new? He/She still wants 67% of MSRP on a 6 year old car? Heck, you can't even get 67% residual on a 3 year lease for an M5! (Granted, the mileage is remarkably low on that car, but still.) I'm pretty sure he's negotiable on the price.  I'd still go check it out if I were you."

I hope this isn't too far off topic, but my wife and I just finished the BMW two day performance driving school. The last event we did was to drive each of three cars for 3 laps around what I would call a small, rather tight road race loop as fast as we wanted to go / as fast as we could go. We first took turns driving a 6 cylinder X-5, and were amazed at how we could sling that vehicle around the corners. Next, we drove an M-5 with SMG. It handled great, and had power, but not as overwhelming as I had imagined. Lastly, we drove a 335i with Steptronic and sport suspension- wow, was that car a screamer! I think over that short loop, with us two ametuers driving, the 335i was faster than the M-5. Just like in my own 535Xi, the engine in the 335i was uber responsive and very fast in acceleration.  One of the instructors said they have driven the 135i. He said they did a drag race with an M-6, and up to about 80 mph the 135i was faster.  Bruce"
4072,habitat1,November 2007,"I agree, that asking price is high by $7-$10k.  However, not sure where you are getting 6 years old. My (late production) 2005 911S is 26 months old. The local BMW dealer wants me to come in for a ""great deal"" on a brand new 2007 550i 6-speed (not a demo 23 miles on odometer). So, worst case scenario, that M5 is just barely 5 years old, possible as little as 4 and a couple of months, but definitely not 6.  And also, don't forget that M5's sold for at least 100%+ of MSRP, with no ability to get European Delivery discounts. So, you can't really compare resale prices of a limited production car like the M5 to a mass produced 550i. The 2007 that the dealer called me on has an MSRP of $69,880. I told him not to waste my time unless he's weilling to take at least $9,000 off and his response was that I could have the car for $61k tomorrow, if I wanted it. At this particiular dealership, if I had asked for a $500 discount on a 2003 M5, I would have been laughed out of the showroom."
4073,tayl0rd,November 2007,"You did see where I said ""it was probably sold in 2002 which means it's near 6 calendar years old,"" right? We're heading headlong into 2008 right now. 2008 - 2002 = 6  Near means close, but not quite, or next to, or in the vacinity of. :P  And why can't I compare the prices? An M5 depreciates the same as any other 5-series. It just has a much higher initial price, and price gouging is NEVER accounted for in resale. The depreciation is relatively the same. Limited edition or not, it's still an outdated model. The mass produced thing is also relative. I believe someone (wasn't it you?) said there are actually more M5s in the States than there are V8 5-series, year-to-year. That would make a V8 non-M 5-series more exclusive and rare than an M5. So my 550i Sport should theoretically hold it's relative value better than an M5! Especially with it being a stick."
4074,spiritinthesky,November 2007,"I happen to own a 2003 M5 with 45k miles. And, coincidentally, before I bought the M5, I had been all set to purchase a 545i Sport 6-speed. The party that had the M5 on order defaulted, dealer called me and I came in with a check for full MSRP that afternoon.  The M5 certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard V8 5-series. At least not in my (Pittsburgh) area. I paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. The 545i had an MSRP of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough estimate by my dealer). The big difference is that the M5 has a dedicated enthusiast following. Everyone knows what it is. The 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice cars, but less than 10% of V8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. The vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily ""driving enthusiast"" demographic. That definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash).  I didn't buy the M5 with resale value being a high consideration. But I'm pretty sure that if I looked at the numbers, I'd get most of the additional $15k I spent on the M5 over the 545i back, if I decided to part with it tomorrow. But I have no interest in doing that. It still drives like the day I bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built M engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 Turbo.  P.S. I bought in May 2003, making it exactly 4 1/2 years old. As in precisely."

Very nice car. 6-sp only at this time, with Tiptronic on the way around April '08. Drives beautifully as a high performance touring coupe.

Of course, I don't like some of the GM-cheapness e.g. the plastic looking grille and, well, the interior. Indeed the issue for me (and I'll assume many potential XLR buyers) is the price. Even a couple of years used, the asking prices compare to some formidable new cars, e.g. aforementioned Corvette, Audi A/S5 and BMW 3, Jag XF among others...  So, more than likely it will be an unfulfilled inexplicable desire. Probably should just save my nickels for a new/cpo Jag XK: Beeeeautiful. Or a Maser Gran Turismo: Mas Beeeeatuiful...

More than likely the Genesis will pull buyers from the Azera, who are mainly Avalon wannabees, and maybe from the Avalon itself.  If Hyundai really wants to make an impact on the upscale market, they need to do what Toyota did with Lexus: Create a new brand with separate dealerships manned with obsequious sales staff. Make the brand flawless and then wait several years for a reputation to build."
4086,blueguydotcom,January 2008,"The brand didn't make Lexus...the LS400 did. The car. The brand was meaningless. 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the Japanese making a RWD V8 sedan that could compete with BMW and MB. The Lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales; the product and the price sold the Lexus LS400 and made Lexus into what it is today (highly overpriced).  Euro snobs laughed at the Japanese competitors and said people wanted an established brand. People wanted a luxury nameplate. People bought the badge. And that's somewhat true. Of course, Lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the Euro competition by well over 10k. Suddenly luxury sedans were well within reach for people who didn't want to fork over dough for a Jag, Benz or Bimmer.  The Genesis will appeal to the same folks and I really seeing it hitting Infiniti, Lexus and Acura the hardest (most likely Acura and Infiniti will take it hard).

True, without the car, the brand is nothing but Lexus' success was built on a decent car at good value (the LS400 was not THAT good) and industry leading dealership experience and service. There are many folks out there who don't know what Edmunds is but like to be treat like kings and queen and Lexus captured them perfectly. Lexus may not know how to build a better driving machine than BMW but they sure do know how to make their brand ""luxurious"" and how to treat their customers right.  Personally I don't think Lexus, Infiniti and Acura have much to worry about with the Genesis. IMO the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Pontiac G8, Buick Lucerne, Toyota Avalon and Hyundai's own Azera are going to be the biggest loser due to the Genesis launch.

4089,blueguydotcom,January 2008,"The price and quality of the LS400 and Q45 sold them. The dealer network may have had a part in repeat sales but initially it was all about a luxury car nearly on par with BMW/MB/Jag for a crazy deal.  Personally, I think Lexus drew in people who aspired to own a luxury car. Hell, today plenty of people in their 20s think Lexus is a luxury make! I think Hyundai will pull in plenty of aspirational buyers."
4090,laurasdada,January 2008,"""...(the LS400 was not THAT good)...""  Actually, the LS400 was that good. I remember (well, I think I remember. I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now...) the reviews: shock and awe. The LS was very much Mercedes-like at ~1/2 the price. The Q was very much BMW-like at ~1/2 the price. But, of course, Infiniti opted for the classic ""Rocks and Sticks"" ad campaign...  The lesser models of Lexus and Inifiniti were just that, lesser. Filler to get folks into the showroom. I agree with BGDC, the big dogs made the marques (much less so Infiniti, of course. They had a much longer and winding road to today's level of success).  The dealer service was also a selling point. I believe the late 80s, early 90s were the height of the German sales arrogance. That had to change..."
4091,blueguydotcom,January 2008,"The G35 came out and offered almost 3 series handling, power, RWD, etc with a whole bunch of rough edges. It saved Infiniti. The I35 and G20 had been huge flops because they didn't match the top dogs at anything, so even for less you were getting much less. The G35 changed entry sport lux. Had the G35 been priced the same as the 3 series, regardless of dealer experience, do you think it would have done 4-6k units a month? The Acura TL at 32-35k is a fantastic deal and we know they move 5-7k a month. Would they push that many at 40k?"
4092,circlew,January 2008,"IMO, the G is what makes the 3 get better, OK, so they added more weight but I'll bet the weight issue is at the top of the ""to do"" list going forward for ALL of the engineers. Think 35 MPG...not to mention that carbon fiber and such lighhtweight componenets will become more prevalent on the lesser ELLPS.  Now, the CTS wants a little respect. OK, so lets see how many sales Caddy takes away from the Germans and the Japanese. I would suspect some interesting numbers considering the exchange rate issue.  Regards, OW"
4093,blueguydotcom,January 2008,"I'm talking about the first gen G35. It's an allusion to the impact the LS had on the luxury market. The G35 took the sport luxury market in a way no one had done before - at least successfully - RWD/ 4 door sedan/manual, RWD/2 door coupe/manual. The first gen was dirt cheap, rouge around the edges and it challenged BMW (and MB/Audi to some bit). The latest one, just like newer gens of the LS, got more expensive and became more refined."
4094,louiswei,January 2008,"The first gen was dirt cheap  True, and the interior looks and felt dirt cheap as well.  However, I do agree that we can compare the first gen G35 to the 3-series like the first gen LS400 to the S-class."
4095,habitat1,January 2008,"Back when the Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 first came out, I was working for a Fortune 500 company and every other VP and SVP started looking at them. Some of it was the better price/value they offered, but at least as much of it was the fear of expensive repairs and maintenace headaches. Lexus gave very good luxury- albeit in a boring to drive chassis - with Toyota like dependability.  By the way, I always enjoy looking back in my old Kelly Blue Book as to what those cars actually cost at the time. The Lexus and Infiniti came out in 1990, but giving them a year to ""establish"" themselves, here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year:  Lexus LS 400: $41,650 / 110"" wheelbase Infiniti Q45: $40,385 / 113"" wheelbase Mercedes E300: $47,550 / 110"" wheelbase Mercedes S420: $64,800 / 121"" wheelbase Mercedes S560: $76,750 / 121"" wheelbase BMW 535i: $43,600 / 108"" wheelbase BMW 735i: $56,500 / 116"" wheelbase  So the Lexus and the Infiniti were sized between the 5/E and 7/S classes, but priced below the 5/E.  What is really interesting is how little Mercedes and BMW prices have increased since 1991. Their ""fat days"" came to an end after Lexus, Infiniti and Acura came to the US - and today BMW's and Mercedes are certainly not exclusively the territory of VP's and above on the corporate ladder. Heck 16 years ago a 1992 Mercedes SL500 roadster had an MSRP of $100k. More than a 2008 Porsche 911S Cabriolet! And more than a 2008 SL550!"
4096,fedlawman,January 2008,"It's not just the luxury cars. The MSRP's of the 1991 Nissan 300ZX Turbo, Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, and BMW M3 were all in the mid to upper $30K's.  Considering that today, $35K buys a 300hp Subaru STi or BMW 135i, you can see just how exotically priced those early-90's halo cars truly were.  On the other hand, I guess one has to consider the cost of the technology back then to mass produce a car that basically, in 1991, had the same performance specs as the current crop of hot GT cars. For instance, put the 300ZX TT and 135i side by side and, by today's standards, the Nissan still holds up (in both performance and styling). Pretty impressive actually..."
4097,louiswei,January 2008,Hmm...  So maybe you German fanboys ought to thank the Japanese to keep MB and BMW honest by not bashing on it too much.
4098,circlew,January 2008,"OK...thank you very much Japan. Now the US can have a go at the Germans  Regards, OW"
4099,circlew,January 2008,"In relative Dollar Value terms, the 1991 S560 would cost $113,603 today. The '08 S550 is $86,700 base but the S600 is $144,200 and S63/65 are $127,000 and $194,000, respectively.  I wouldn't be concerned that Merc profits are hurting that much from Lexus or Infinity.

I am averaging 23 mpg (calculated, computer says 24-25) and I accelerate rather briskly and the freeway portion is at a median speed of 80 mph. I imagine that if I drove slower or acellerated easier I might get 2 mpg more, but nothing is worth going slow. :P  I recently fueled up near the freeway, did a hard acceleration to get on the main road, then another hard run on the on ramp and then drove about 8 miles at 80 mph and saw an indicated 28 mpg, clearly the stop and go takes it's toll on my commute, and it's only 1/3 of the miles. Still, I could not be happier, I love the car and it's hard to cough at 23 mpg average in any car that weighs over 3000 lbs, let alone one that is a luxury car with nearly 300 hp."
4102,irvine555,March 2008,"I'm looking to buy a TL at the end of the year. I know by then the '09s will be out. How much of a price drop do yall think they will have on the 08 models (especially since they'll be 3rd generation unlike the 09's). Also do yall think with the new options on the '09 models that are being discussed on this forum (AWD and more horsepower) it's worth it to get an '09 or just get the '08.  P.S.---I live in Louisiana so front wheel drive is not a problem (we don't see snow but every 10 years, lol). Also do yall think its worth it to get the S-type since its just a few thousand more than the basic one with the Nav. system.  Thanks so much"
4103,johninnj,March 2008,I fondly remember the mpg of my TL days....it made my G35 feel like an old Muscle car. Anything with 250+ hp in stop and go is gonna suck....but the TL is amazing on the highway.
4104,ivan_99,March 2008,"I wouldn't go as far as saying amazing...  Not to get into a mine is better than yours, but...  My Q45 with a 340hp V8 routinely achieves over 25mpg on the highway. I once (painfully) stuck to the speed limit and achieved 28mpg. I even hit 25mpg total for an entire trip.  But...around town it does suck the gas back...I average 17-19 combined (usually stop and go highway travel ).  I've never had below 16mpg or greater than 20 for combined driving.  I had a G35 (03) and it would get a combined 19-20mpg  You do hear about 335i's, 911's getting impressive mpg and both have high hp/performance figures.  I'd say the TL is ""ok"", but not great."
4105,johninnj,March 2008,Sorry if we differ (I've always though the Q was about the most ignored performance sedan ever for the record) 70-80 mph on New Jersey Turnpike would ALWAYS yield very high 20's or low 30's in the TL with auto...and I have a pretty heavy foot. Around town they all suck....no question there.
4106,kdshapiro,March 2008,"My Q45 with a 340hp V8 routinely achieves over 25mpg on the highway.  Interestingly enough the 1001 HP Bugatti achieves 22 mpg on the highway, but to drive it in traffic you have have a gas station in tow."
4107,riorebel,March 2008,"It will be hard for anyone to answer that question for you. I had no intention of getting the S-type, but after driving the Infiniti G35, the base TL did not have enough power for me. I was willing to pay for the extra horsepower.  If you don't care as much about the difference in power, I'd save the money and buy the base model. The lip spoiler is not that attractive, IMO, and the other differences are not significant."
4108,ivan_99,March 2008,"We'd differ again  The Q's not very sporty (at all). Far to mushy, floaty, isolated and over-boosted (wife's idea).  It's powerful; especially once underway and the tranny kicks down.  I'd take a manual TL over the Q any day :blush:"
4109,kyfdx,March 2008,Is that the same Bugatti that runs through a full tank of gas in 12 minutes at top speed? :surprise:
4110,pv2,March 2008,"Re the Bugatti, at top speed (253mph) you'd cover 50 miles in 12 minutes. Don't know where you can find a stretch that long anywhere (legal or not)."
4111,blueguydotcom,March 2008,I-5 north of the grapevine there's nothing for hundreds of miles. I-15 running out to vegas has long - 50+ mile stretches with nothing. I've done hyper-legal speeds on both.
4112,riorebel,March 2008,"All that being said, how likely is it that you could go 253mph for 50 miles without being stopped?  If you can do that, even on I-15, you need to go immediately to the casino and start betting like hell, because you've got some serious mojo going."
4113,circlew,March 2008,"Wait a minute...who would be able to stop you in a Bugati V anyway?  Oh, I get it! Just wait until the gas runs out and you eventually will get see it on the side of the road. As I remember, there is no gas for huge stretches between after the CA line and Vegas.  Regars, OW"

(luxury being mostly artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, I don't consider ANY of these ""luxury"" cars).  They're not luxury cars. What Edmunds considers a luxury car  People gave Volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 Turbo.  And Volvo still doesn't get respect.  RX-8 appeals to a niche audience. The back seat is unusable, while in the IS250 it's barely useable. Unless you're driving pygmies around all day. The RX-8 gets you Mazda service, while the IS250 gets you Lexus service. The RX-8 wins as a better track vehicle, the IS250 with AWD wins as a better street vehicle. The RX-8 has to be revved to the moon to get horsepower. If 100% of your driving is on the track, I agree RX-8 wins. For the rest of us...."
4121,kdshapiro,March 2008,You are not the target market for a 528 either
4122,sjaieve,March 2008,"No I will never buy the 528, Lexus GS350 is a far better car IMO. Infiniti M35 is also a better buy for the price. I canr afford those cars though"
4123,kdshapiro,March 2008,"M35 is also a better buy for the price.  The 5 has been the consistent sales leader in this segment. Maybe BMW is giving the people what they want, although I can certainly understand why this car isn't for you."
4124,laurasdada,March 2008,"Back in '05, my final two were the TL and the G35x. I chose the TL because the TL offered (imo, of course):  Smoother, quieter ride. G had a bit too much road/wind noise. And while the engine growl is kinda lovely, I just heard it too much. Better styling, both exterior and interior. Higher quality interior bits and pieces. Better mpg (child of ""gas crisis"" '70s...) I didn't really want the added weight/complexity of AWD. I'm a lifelong New Englander and skier, FWD has just done me fine (until the TL! Another story, but get snow tires...)  Of course, this was Gen 1 G35. Fun to drive, powerful and I'm sure had I chosen it I'd be all smiles. But, my priorities ruled in the TLs favor. And I still dig it!  As Gen 2 G is an improvement, just test drive the heck out of each of 'em. No wrong decision will be made. Also, note that a new gen TL is just down the road..."
4125,blueguydotcom,March 2008,"Or put another way, people aspire to drive a BMW, an Audi a Lexus, I am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a Mazda  Those people who aspire to drive an Audi or BMW or Lexus must not have access to autotrader or used cars? Average sale price of cars is 30k. A 3 series moderately outfitted can run less than that. Audi's go in the 20s. Shrug. With the explosion of 30k+ SUVS and Crossovers, I doubt anyone really aspires to drive a Lexus or Bimmer."
4126,sjaieve,March 2008,"Yes you are right, the 5 sells almost twice as much as the GS or the M35. I think you present a good argument that BMW is giving people what they want. I cant dispute that, the sales support this. You took the argument to a segment I am not very familiar with, as I said before, I can't afford the car in that segment, and my comments will not really hold water, but here goes.  For 52k, I can get an almost fully loaded GS350. For the same amount, I am not going to get the same options in the 528, now, given that the GS350 is faster than the 528, I think the Lex is a better buy. I dont believe one should drive a car that is worth 50k and have cheaper cars, run circles around such a car. This to me is totaly unacceptable. If one pays 50k, you need a car that has everything else that the cheaper cars have, plus more. The GS350 gives you that, the 528 does not.  I believe BMW makes good cars, but the pricing does not make sense to me, I attribute the higher prices to lack of the economies of scale that Nissan and Toyota has, since their luxury brands share the same parts as the parent company's cars."
4127,blueguydotcom,March 2008,"Wow, someone called the 3.0 a miserable engine? that's baffling. I miss two things about my BMWs... RWD and that obscenely smooth engine. Nothing like the inline 6 in any other make. Like buttah."

Your car priorities must place emphasis on numb steering, touchy brakes, pillow soft suspensions, and gadgets galore (NAV, Mark Levinson Audio). I'm into a car that drives like it doesn't weigh so much with communicative steering, excellent body control and handling ability."
4132,fedlawman,March 2008,"Sure the Lexus is quicker to 60, but who cares. Where's the clutch? What do you do when you have to - god forbid - turn the steering wheel?  Why not just get a Buick and save $20,000?  There's nothing like a BMW I-6. It may not be quick, but my friend's E36 325ic (5-speed MT) is a joy to drive just for the sound and feel of that engine.

4136,irvine555,March 2008,"Thanks for the info riorebel and laurasdada. When the time comes for me to choose (end of the year), I'll probably test drive each one once or twice and then sit down and write my own positives and negatives and then choose. In the end, it doesn't seem like I can go wrong with any choice I make though.  Question: How much of a diff. is there between the TL compared to the TL-S with regard to how smooth the car rides, handles, etc. Also how does the G-35x compare to its other models the G-35 Journey, etc.  My girlfriend is the same as your wife riorebel, she hates all American cars (except the Corvette) and she hates Toyotas. I think the hate for Toyotas stems from her having a bad experience with a Corolla (her first car) like 10 years ago (I think it was a '92). She doesn't even want me to look at Lexus. On a side note, my parents have been buying Toyotas for the past 10 years and love them. My mom drives a '97 Avalon (bought brand new in '97), and has only put 32,000 on it in the last 10-11 years (she just pretty much goes to the store and goes home).  riorebel, thanks for the SEC support. Honestly I cheer for every team in the SEC except AUBURN. As much as BAMA fans hate AUBURN, I would have to say LSU fans are right behind yall on that hate. Yall look to have a promising year (thanks to good recruiting), so good luck this year, except in Tiger Stadium."
4137,sjaieve,March 2008,"Agreed. I want an automatic car, as many bells and whistles as I can afford, power thats above par, in this day and age 300hp does the trick, no need to be competing with a nissan altima V6 in a 43k 528i.  Driving dynamics that were described in other posts are a matter of opinion. I will stick with facts here, the engine used in the Lexus 3.5 litre engine is in the wards top ten list, together with the 335i's engine. If you buy a 528i cos of driving dynamics, more power to you, I will buy the faster car, you can stick with your driving synamics behind me  I am in my late 20s, so gadgets are pretty important"

4142,lockgiants,March 2008,"Personally I think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the G and TL serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. I bought a TL for a simple reason: value and location. I didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded G35 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the G better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the G or the IS350 are better options. but the TL is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either."
4143,pat,March 2008,how 'bout we back to these cars now?
4144,chirocat,March 2008,"I really liked the G35, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an Ipod jack IMHO. The biggest complaint I have with the G35 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. My previous car was a 98 Maxima and it was tiring having the engine at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. The G35 gearing was almost the same, whereas the TL-S is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 RPM (2750). A few milder negatives with the G was the lack of smoothness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the R32 was the most expensive). I added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the TL-S got the nod. I probably would have loved the G35 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. Either way, you can't go wrong, they are all awesome cars. :shades:"
4145,scwmcan,March 2008,"Actually it's the entry level luxury sedan thread, not a TL thread, so there should be a balanced opinion, that said the one to buy is the one he like best, there really is no wrong answer. Scott"
4146,pat,March 2008,This started out in one of the TL discussions. I moved the thread here.
4147,adamr001,March 2008,"I test drove a lot of cars before I chose the G35.  The TL was one of them. My main complaint about the TL was / is FWD. The car has all the usual FWD problems and didn't handle being ""upset"" in mid-corner nearly as well as the RWD cars I tested (nor as well as some of the other FWDs (9-3) either).  I liked the car, I liked the price, but I couldn't get past the FWD and handling.  If you test drive a G35, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel Active Steering. Seriously. The difference between a Sport and 4WAS-Sport still amazes me.  Some of the other cars I test-drove were: Lexus IS350 : Only complaints, rear seats slightly too small, no Manual Transmission option, otherwise this was the ""best"" car I drove from an overall perspective. BMW335i : Excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. It didn't leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. I can't really explain it better than that. I just didn't wow me. BMW328i : Not in the same ballpark as the other cars I drove. Lacks the power. Saab 9-3 Aero : FWD again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking. There were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury (WRX STi, VW STi, etc.)  Ultimately, it's all about what you want.  I wanted (in order of importance) 4 doors Sport Luxury interior + toys Manual Transmission  Thus I chose the G35."

4150,jeffmo2334,March 2008,"I thought I'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the TL and G35.  I have been a Honda guy, so at first was not even considering the G35, and so was looking at the TL, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. A friend recommended I look at the G35's, so at first I just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a Sunday so I couldn't test drive one), and I thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided I would consider it.  I test drove the TL (not type S) and, while it was solid, I was not swept away. I was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. I then test drove the G35 and was blown away with how the engine performed. Very responsive, and I like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving style.  I thought I'd end up paying a lot more for the G35 given the incentives offered on the TL's, but actually found that the G35 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. The 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate I could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the TL incentive. Also, I was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car I wanted (Journey with Premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. This is not far from what I could get on a TL, even with the model changing, and this way I get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car I like better.  Anyway, I think both cars are great, but I prefer the G35. My main issue was the engine's performance and exterior styling.  Jeff"

4152,shipo,March 2008,"You might want to consider fuel economy given the price of fuel these days. The TL is well known for delivering decent fuel economy in spite of its powerful motor; the G35 not so much.  Best Regards, Shipo"

4154,jeffmo2334,March 2008,"Good point on the fuel economy.  The G35 seems to average 17-19mpg in mixed driving, while the TL is in the low 20's. I think the 5-speed automatic has something to do with that, since even on the highway it revs at a pretty high rpm.  Jeff"
4155,jeffmo2334,March 2008,"Thank you, I am! :shades:  My wife was against the purchase (gas mileage/cost) until she actually drove the car. Now she loves it and wants to take it (instead of our 07 Odyssey) whenever she runs an errand without the kids  Funny thing, since a few weeks ago she always wanted to take the Odyssey out on errands (instead of my previous car, a 1993 Geo Prizm) :P"
4156,adamr001,March 2008,"Well my observations are that even with the 6mt gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. If you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. It doesn't seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if I accellerate hard or soft. It's the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. If I maintain speed / cruise milage climbs immediately."
4157,shipo,March 2008,"To be sure, for any given car, if you keep your foot out of it, it will deliver better fuel economy, however, some cars are still more adept at getting better mileage than others, and in this class of cars, the G35 seems to consistently deliver the worst fuel economy.  Best Regards, Shipo"
4158,adamr001,March 2008,"Oh, I didn't say that it didn't. The G35 is more sports car than performance luxury sedan.  It's just that I can make my G35 hit 20mpg in mixed driving or I can make it hit 17mpg. All by how I keep my foot on / off the pedal. On the highway, under cruise, I have no problems hitting 27mpg. Without cruise I run about 23mpg.  To be sure, the G35 isn't a fuel efficient vehicle."
4159,jeffmo2334,March 2008,"I think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the G35 tends to get worse gas mileage than the TL -- by 2-3 mpg or so. One must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the G35 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a little more for gas.  I drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in Houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. For me, I liked the G35 at least that much more than the TL, so I don't mind paying the extra gas $$. Even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and I am still OK with that difference.  If all else was equal and I liked the TL just as much as the G35, then I would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.  Mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.  Jeff"

It seems that you think that by taking a large FWD sled and then dropping in a big motor and slapping on some sticky rubber, it will suddenly be transformed into a ""Sports Sedan"". Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but the LaCrosse doesn't even come close to meeting the criteria as a Sports Sedan.  If you don't believe me that the LaCrosse doesn't measure up, that's fine, consult the car comparison web site of your choice and look at the cars the ""experts"" think the Buick competes with.

Great in a straight line, but that's it.  A Sports Sedan/Coupe is: RWD or AWD. Manual available. As close to 3000lbs as possible. An emphasis on handling over straight line performance and HP.  Buick is: FWD. Automatic only. Nearly 4000lbs. Insanely powerful and overbuilt.  It's a muscle car. Is it any surprise considering what company made it? GM groks muscle cars, after all.  Compare it to a Impreza, RX-8, or GLI. (yes, these aren't luxury, though they are the essence of sporty). Dropping in leather and a bigger engine - that's Mercedes trick.

Regarding that crack you made yesterday about me researching what I post before I post, well, I think the content of the last many posts (forgetting yours of course) plus the two cited reviews (including the one you referenced) pretty much says it all.

If that guy keeps talking about FWD sedan, maybe a Saab 9-3 is the best Sport Sedan for GM because it is more a sport sedan than the Buick (I know, it may not have the best handling but it is not bad at all).However, it is a Swedish (import again). I remembered the Viggen has 155mph top speed too and most 9-3 can go beyond 145mph (4 cyls turbo vs. Buick's...).

I've got them for almost 2 months now and I am happy so far with the performance and the look. With the springs the body roll has been dramatically reduced, the artificial stiffness feel has been replace by a better (or should I say normal) stiffness feel and the steering response also improved slightly. Upon installation, the suspension actually felt softer than the stock setup but once it's settled down after couple weeks, that ""softness"" was gone. Kind of weird but other users have also reported about this.  I've lowered the front by 1"" and rear by 0.8"". It's a mild drop.  Here are some pictures with the Eibach springs:"

4192,louiswei,March 2008,"Thanks nyccarguy and fedlawman, The lower stance definitely gives the car a more aggressive look. One thing I like about the Europeans such as the 3er and C-class is that with the sports package, the cars are already sit at a lower height than their Japanese counterparts.  Last time I checked, now I am at at little over 27k miles. You are right about the suspension modifications and I think my next task will be adding strut and sway bars to the car."

4197,cdnpinhead,March 2008,"Well, for starters, when I use your numbers I come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. However, I'd submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere I'm likely to travel.  Besides which, I neither need nor want a 335d. I'd buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the UK and Europe is that I'll get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines. Now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, I think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.  However, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. The trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet A for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being transported. As we've already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significantly, people use less -- it's discretionary to a much larger extent.  Should be interesting to see this play out."

4221,r34,April 2008,"Actually Saab is not big. It may not have the good handling as the Bimmer's and it may not have good interior as the Audi's. However, it is a nice overall package. It gives you a taste of European car with an Accord price (after all incentives). It belongs to highway. The turbo is amazing. You can feel safe driving it with triple digits (like most European cars). You can drive some cars in triple digits but you will not feel safe because they were not built for autobahnn speed.  I don't trust certain car reviews. People need to test drive the cars."
4222,alltorque,April 2008,"Inline engines also have much less mechanical complexity. V engines are a design nightmare - angles and extra connecting rods and multiple camshafts and...  That adds weight as well. And worsens efficiency. So as a result, you can make a smaller I-6 than a V6 and get the same results. So often, you can fit the I-6 in the car as well as a V6.  Forgive me for being pedantic but why would a V6 need more connecting rods than an I6 ? Also, don't forget that you make make a shorter, (in length and lose a little height), engine in V6 than of the same bore I6.............can see some benefits there. Of course Flat 6's are even better, albeit rather rare. Subaru and Porsche being the only ones that come to mind in current production.  No particular preference for V or I - just like 6's in general and 5 cylinder diesels in particular, (yes, I know, it's my age )."
4223,tayl0rd,April 2008,Forgive me for being pedantic but why would a V6 need more connecting rods than an I6 ? ...  It doesn't. Six cylinders are six cylinders.

4224,alltorque,April 2008,"Ah, so it wasn't just an old Brit missing something, then. That's reassuring.  My first car was a 1956 Vauxhall Velox - sort of U.K. take on an early-50's Chevy something; all rounded and nice. That had a 2262cc I6 that pumped out a mind-blowing 59bhp, (but a fair bit of torque), and was coupled to a 3M 'box. First was so low that you could use it for pulling up tree stumps. Even that amount of power could embarass the cross-ply tyres of the day. All black body, lots of chrome and a carnation pink & white interior, (2 x 3 seat benches), plus valve radio. You could definitely see the GM influence. Happy days. :shades:"

4227,plekto,April 2008,"I meant more parts in the connecting rods. I see it as having pultiple connecting rods since it has more than one part between the piston and the crankshaft.  *** from wiki on 60 degree engines*** However, more modern designs often use a 3-throw crankshaft with what are termed flying arms between the crankpins, which not only give the required 120° separation but also can be used for balancing purposes. Combined with a pair of heavy counterweights on the crankshaft ends, these can eliminate all but a modest secondary imbalance which can easily be damped out by the engine mounts *** So you don't have piston. rod. crankshaft. like in an inline engine. You have a bunch of intermediary parts kludged together to keep it from shaking itself apart.  GM's 90 degree designs are even more complex and run even rougher, being designed off of V8 engines. Actually quite nasty, really. They tend to eat through engine mounts fairly regularly.  The reason you don't see many I6s is because they usually won't fit in a FWD car due to there needing to be space for the CV joints and transmission as well. Thankfully it is making a comeback as makers are slowly realizing what a giant turd FWD technology is, especially in vehicles with over 200HP."
4228,cdnpinhead,April 2008,""". . .plus valve radio.""  I also remember tube (valve) radios in cars -- they took awhile to warm up and really could run down the battery if left on while the engine (with its generator) was shut down. Lots of things have improved tremendously in automobiles over the past 50 years, but many of them add weight.  My '65 MGB was lots of fun to drive & own, with the knock-offs, wire wheels, the tightest steering I've ever had and shifter feel that was unequalled. Safe? Not really. Powerful? No. Radio quality? Awful. Still, a wonderful car."
4229,shipo,April 2008,"Ummm, I'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from Wikipedia. True, most V6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some distance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. FWIW, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.  Actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, V6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an I6. Why is that? Simple, your typical V6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical I6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. In spite of this difference, I6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a V6 of an otherwise similar design.  Best Regards, Shipo"

4235,bfluegie,April 2008,"I&#146;m looking for a new (to me) ride. I don&#146;t have to decide just now, but probably sometime in the next couple of months. I thought I&#146;d post this here as well as on the &#147;help me decide&#148; forum because this seems to be a very active discussion. Some of the cars I am considering do fit this category, so it&#146;s not too much of a stretch. What I am considering is a (probably) pre-owned BMW 325xi (maybe a 330xi if the deal is right, but I&#146;m not too sure I want a turbo), G35x (I have VPP so I might go new for this), Audi A3 or A4 (I like the A3 better but they&#146;re hard to find in the northern IN vicinity), Acura TSX or maybe TL, but it&#146;s larger and I don&#146;t like it as much. I might consider the Altima coupe as well, but not the sedan. While I like the sedan styling more than the Accord or Camry, I don&#146;t like it as much as the Infinity, and the Altima sedans are everywhere. I don&#146;t want to put my car away for the winter, so I prefer all wheel or front wheel drive. That leaves out the Infinity G-coupe (sigh) and the BMW 3 series coupe. I know several people who drive the G coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires. I prefer the security of good winter handling. I haven&#146;t completely ruled out a small SUV or crossover, but after 8 years of driving an Exploder I&#146;m ready for a more responsive ride. I joke about the Explorer, but with the exception of an unfortunate &#147;Bambi&#148; incident I have never been left stranded. No significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either. It just has over 130K miles and it is time to move on to something else. As long as I&#146;m moving on, I want to add some fun. I won&#146;t be racing or pushing for maximum speed, but I do like the feel of a car that you don&#146;t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve. I suppose I want to feel like I am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle.  I would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. I know the Infinity was a new model in 2007 but I like the previous model as well. The BMW was a new model in 2006 and I don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. I might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional cars to consider (or avoid) are welcome. I&#146;m considering a manual in the BMW or A4 but I didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 TL I drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when I lurched on a start). I don&#146;t know if the TSX would be any better. The G35X is only available in an auto. Manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so I probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto BMW or Audi either. Since I&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years."
4236,ivan_99,April 2008,"You have a wide range of requirements...but you didn't clarify the price range you're looking for or any requirement for seating/space.  I'm also assuming you're looking at purchasing as opposed to leasing  For coupes...If you don't need back seat room very often a TT would be a nice ""cool"" coupe to have (2.0T FWD). A new Accord Coupe with the I4 5spd would be very economical but look a little different than everything else. I'm a big fan of the A5 (S-line)...especially the S5 (love the torque...gets pricey)...A5 with FWD and manual (s-line) starts in the low 40's. And of course the new BMW 1 series.  4-doors...If you can wait the new A4 looks very interesting...the base IS250 can be had with manual and it starts our at a reasonable price...though NOT FWD (have yet to drive). I recently drove a CTS (doesn't get much love) both high end and base (manual) and found them very compelling (but probably not for my $'s)  Manual...If you're weighing the pros and cos of a manual versus automatic you can check out VW's DSG. Last year I drove a VW Jetta fahrenheit and it was the most amazing FWD car I've driven (was 27k ish...)  Non-Domestic? Most of you choices seem to be ""non-domestic"" If you want FWD you can add Volvo (S30, S40). Saab 08, 9-3 Turbo X looks aggressive."
4237,alltorque,April 2008,"Volvo C30 is cute but quite small and only 2 doors, (+hatch of course). S40 is nice and about 3-series size. S60 is a tad bigger than the 3-series, (but only a tad), and gets my vote - biased owner; albeit a diesel with Geartronic. S80 is well worth a look.  Saab's are rated a bit so-so here in U.K. but are premium priced. Audi good in whatever size. A6 is about S80 size.  Can't comment on the others, apart from VW, but the current ones are good."
4238,bfluegie,April 2008,"Thanks for the input Ivan. While I have not ruled out domestic, I haven't found the blend of performance, features, and solid feel in many domestic cars. Pricewise, I'm trying to stay in the mid 30s or lower. While I could afford more, that's where the comfort zone starts to end and the panic zone begins. The A5 could get me to make an exception, though. Seeing that beauty in my garage every morning could calm a lot of panic.  I hadn't considered the Jetta Fahrenheit and I will have to check it out. I have driven the DSG, though in an A3 Quattro. I really liked that car. I forgot the A4 was heading for a redesign. I'll have to check that out as well. The current CTS looks sharp and I can get the supplier discount (below invoice) so I might look there as well. Thank you for some very good suggestions."
4239,bfluegie,April 2008,"Thanks for the input. I forgot to add in my reply to ivan_99 that I might look at the Volvos as well. I get the supplier discount on them as well so I could get a little more car there as well. I have always liked the looks of the Saab 9-3 (especially the convertible) but the reliability issues I have read about have made me cautious. The Edmunds review posted earlier in this forum makes it seem worth a look as well. I'm not sure about the pricing, but looking is fun.  Thanks again."

The 3.0 with 220 hp/220 ft-lbs jumps to 4000 lbs.  Comparing the a4 cab to the IS250 is sorta misleading and not representative of comparing an IS250 to an A3.

The RS4 is only 6 months old and no hiccups but same friend also has a Ferrari F355 which seems to go wrong on just about every trip...............to the extent that he's gonna sell it as he thinks the RS4 is a far better-built car, damn near as fast, far more useable and it doesn't attract the wrong sort of attention from the boy-racers or constabulary, (we have a couple of Subaru Imprezza WRX police cars locally which do send out a certain Clint Eatwood-esque message.

This car also suffers from an anemic engine (at least until you wind it up even higher than the Acura's already high strung mill) and a back seat that is all but laughable. In every respect, this car is a very distant third of the three.  Best Regards, Shipo"
4248,darrinzramz,June 2008,"Hi need some answers if possible,I have a G35 sedan 2004,I've been using 87 octane in my car w/no problems at all.Seems to me when gas gauge reads full,I watch the gas gauge over the course of the week,and I notice it stays up near-full for the 1st 85-100 miles I put on the car,then all of the sudden the gas gauge seems to go down quite quickly from there.I'm medium on the gas on occasion I will get on it medium to slightly hard,it seems I'm only getting 15.6mi/gal,does that seem a bit much or not!!!????.Anyways I've change the plugs to a performance plug also I installed a K&N filter,there is no gas leaks what so ever!!!,any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,I also do use my cruise contol also,do mostly city driving though, not alot of stop and go,thanks Darrin Lynch"
4249,shipo,June 2008,"A few points:  1) Over the decades I've had dozens of cars that were from Asia, North America and Europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge characteristics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). This is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge sensor.  2) IIRC, Infiniti recommends ""Premium"" gasoline for your 2004 G35 engine (an engine well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your Owners Manual to be sure. Assuming that's the case, by running regular you are forcing the engine management system to retard the ignition timing to keep the engine from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel you're feeding it. In turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your engine.  3) Given how modern engine management systems work, it is physically impossible for a K&N filter to improve fuel economy. In fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.  4) Based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mostly city driving"".  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.  Best Regards, Shipo"
4250,ghstudio,June 2008,"The nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...it's still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. It is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. It is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but I've tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06 M35 and I've seen no difference in MPG or pep. A larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. I doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.  Fuel guage is what it is...I think it was the old BMW where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. It's rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when you're down to 1/8 a tank.  High performance plugs and ""high efficiency"" air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. Actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using ANY additives in the car.  If you aren't driving aggressively, then about the only thing you can do that will really improve mileage is to turn off the A/C."

Why you would use low octane on a higher performance engine is foreign to me.  My car weighs 3,700 lbs and still gets acceptable gas mileage on standard A/S tires because each month I regulate tire pressure and rotate the tires each 5K miles.  Tires last longer, wear even and get the best efficiency as a result.  It doesn't take much to get the specified MPG rating for your car if you are aware of the small details.  Regards, OW"
4252,1nickatnite1,June 2008,"I don't know about 04 g35s but with the current ones you cannot rotate the tires. 15.6 mpg does sound low but if it is mostly city driving and since you admit to driving with a ""medium to heavy"" foot it is not that surprising.

Aside from that it has needed one set of brakes at 60,000 miles and tires at 46,000. The Inspection II(major) service and a brake fluid flush at 65,000 miles cost less than $370. The 318ti is my part-time track rat(note that its running costs include four sets of track rubber). In the 15 years I've owned it it's needed two sets of front pads and one set of rear pads along with four rotors. I've also replaced the drive belts and idler pulleys, the brake light switch, battery and the thermostat, all of which costs less than $550. My last Inspection II cost $495, and that number included a coolant flush and a four wheel alignment. In contrast, my Mazda has needed major mechanical and suspension repairs- it will soon be replaced with either an M3 or M5."
4263,plekto,January 2010,"The problem stems from the suppliers for electronics in Europe that German companies use. With their insane taxes, they are pretty much forced to use Bosch and a few other makers for their switches and electrical components in the vehicle to keep costs down(Porsche doesn't but they also charge the difference and then some).  Conversely, most of the better stuff in the world comes from Korea and Japan, so the components that cause the repairs don't fall fail half as often. The trick, of course, is to get a Japanese or Korean made vehicle that isn't full of Chinese and Malaysian and wherever else labor is cheap electrical and mechanical parts."

For instance, the Mercedes engines are fantastic. But the rest of the car isn't put together any better than a Chevrolet(and for 2-3x the price, it had better be a LOT better in those areas) Don't even get me started on the pleather/MB Tex nonsense...

Now, true, there were cheap aftermarket parts to be had, but I can guarantee that since we're talking luxury and sport sedans and the like here, Lexus isn't going to be ""cheap"" to fix.  If you look at the lists from 2008, it shows Isuzu(Chevrolet trucks), Infiniti, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai as taking most of the entire list. Toyota isn't there and neither are any of the European brands.(or Cadillac)  edit: If you go back to 2006, Toyota is on the list.

One can bring their cars to a third party mechanic for major work.  We are talking what happens after warranty when the tranny fails, water pump fails, alternator fails, o2 sensor fails, fuel pump fails, engine blows up. How much does an Infiniti alternator cost, vs a BMW, vs a Lexus?  The first three years, 4 for BMW, are covered by B2B you can take the car to the dealer for warranty work and Jiffy Lube for oil changes. You can spend as much, or as little as you want on service. There are people who are DYI and people who bring it to the dealer.  It's when the warranty expires what are the price of the parts and labor, and to even the playing field I'd suggest using dealer rates, not third party mechanics."
4278,jimbres,February 2010,"At least BMWs cost $0 for the first four years.  Well, no. The cost of the ""free"" maintenance is baked into the purchase price of the car. You pay for it up front.

The rest of the point is how expensive are these vehicles when the warranty expires. There are those who believe Infinitis are cheap to own. I assert all of the vehicles are cheap to own for the first three years. But to calculate the costs, one has to assume, either all third party maintenance or all dealer maintenance...except for BMWs.  My assertion is after the B2B an Infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a Lexus water pump as a BMW water pump...or at least close enough for government work."

Rolls Royce, Bentley, Bugatti, Maybach are surely top of the heap and then there is a whole slew of builders who would tie for the next places. MB would have the ""S"" class in there but not much else in the past 5-10 years. Here in UK they rate pretty poor in JD Power surveys. Lexus always beats 'em - as do Skoda, and that's a VW cheapo-brand, (although it also beats VW and Audi every time).  Then, of course, Maybach is to MB as Lexus is to Toyota."

The only way to buy one, then, is manual everything and no options at all and with a manual transmission. They sell these in Europe but not in the U.S.(barring gems like the C230K they made a few years ago)  The best built for cars is actually a near tie between Nissan, Mazda, and Honda. Honda gets the 3# place(by maybe a foot behind the others) if only because their prices on parts have gone up in the last few years.  For trucks and SUVs, Nissan and Toyota if you get one with a manual transmission, that is."

4290,roadburner,February 2010,fedlawman;  I might be buying a 54K mile E30 M3. I'm just trying to decide if I should use it as my daily driver.
4291,fedlawman,February 2010,"That's a tough one. One the one hand, what a shame to ""use up"" such a low mileage example just commuting to and from work. On the other hand, these cars are not exotic collector cars and they're meant to be driven. There are lots of factory and aftermarket parts out there to keep it on the road indefinitely, so as it ages and wears, you'll never have trouble keeping it in tip top shape. As long as you don't mind the thought of watching it get old and used up, I think it's fine as a DDer. It's funny, I know a couple of people who own E30 garage queens and can't help feeling some resentment towards them because I think it's such a waste, but I also know that if I owned one of those E30's, I'd probably be inclined to ""preserve"" it too. Maybe that's why my 210,000 mile restored M3 is right for me. It looks and runs great, but on close inspection, it will never be mistaken for a show car.  Also, I guess I should to admit to you that I don't think I could drive mine every day. I love driving my M3 on the weekends and during the summer, I do drive it to work occasionally just because it's just such a joy on a nice day. Oftentimes though, I'm grateful I have a 4-door slushbox company car for my commute - especially during the winter months. A smooth, quiet ride, with cupholders and an automatic transmission is usually what I want when the weather is gloomy, I'm tired, and I just want to get where I'm going without any drama.  Honestly, I wish I had kept my E30 325is when I got my M3. Having both would have been perfect - the 325 is a much better DDer, still a lot of fun to drive, fun to tinker on, and parts are cheaper. It doesn't have to be another E30, but if you can do it, buy the M3 for when you want to drive, but have something else for when you have to drive.  EDIT: I guess I didn't really answer your question, did I? Sorry, I'm tired and honestly, I go back and forth about my M3 lately. There's nothing else like it and I love it, but sometimes when the rear speakers stop working, the interior lights fail, or a dashboard panel comes loose, I secretly think to myself that a Cayman S would be so much easier to live with. But that's crazy talk...very few cars are more fun to drive, and none of them have a back seat and trunk. It's really a very special, fantastic car - arguably the best BMW has ever produced. If I ever do part with mine, I'll be forever grateful that I had the privilege and pleasure of owning and driving one."

I have always thought that I would like to have one at some time, but I know the repairs are very expensive. In Europe, they are a fairly common car. Here, they are luxury."
4295,plekto,February 2010,"Automatic transmissions live and die based upon their electronics and hydraulic components. Often when the system fails, the oil overheats and cooks the inside or damages something and the entire thing turns into a brick that needs to be completely pulled apart and rebuilt. As, say, opposed to an old hydraulic only design like Ford and GM used to make a decade or two ago - just replace the torque converter 90% of the time for cheap and you're done.($800-$1200 repair vs a whole new unit)  Mercedes makes its cars in Europe with manuals only, essentially. They add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. As a result, it's almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds - just put something in and ship it out the door, who cares as it's not going to someone who cares or can't afford the maintainance.  They don't re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a Chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it(trust me - the designs are still very similar on the automatics).  The only way to avoid this is to buy a manual like 80%+ of Europe does. The problem is, of course, that almost nothing shipped TO the U.S. by Mercedes(or most other makers other than VW) is offered with a manual."
4296,kdshapiro,February 2010,"At some point in time for three seconds it might have been true. Clearly Mercedes lost it's focus for a while, but they have been working to get it back.

And when all's said and done, I don't recall the M3 being any less civilized than my Mazdaspeed... The thing is, I keep reading about how you should get an E30 M3 while they're still relatively cheap- and then there's the incomparable racing heritage. I guess the hook was set back in 1989, when I spent a day lapping Sears Point(Infineon) in a friend's 1989 M3. At any rate, I don't have to decide right away, but I will need to make a call sooner than later."

Mine's somewhat modified, as you know, so it's not nearly as quiet and comfortable as I imagine a stock M3 must be. Even so, the S14 has never been described as refined, and even a stock M3 is gonna rattle, buzz, and vibrate all over. I swear, sometimes I think the car is trying to shake itself to pieces. The solution, of course, is to keep the revs above 5000 - my car just sings between 5K and 8K.  The right time to buy is when you find a good one.

4300,rayainsw,February 2010,"As mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are currently the BMW 335iS & the Audi S4.  I learned something about the Audi transmission behavior since I tested the first one available in the Atlanta area. So I decided to take another short test drive on Saturday morning. To see if what I had learned had a significant effect of the aspects of the dual clutch seven speed S Tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.  And the short answer is: Yes.  The fact that I did not know is the existence of a kickdown switch in the S4&#146;s throttle travel.  From page 134 of the Owner&#146;s Manual: &#147;Kick-down  Kick-down enables maximum acceleration.  When you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the resistance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and engine RPM. It shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified engine RPM is reached&#148;  My two objections to the transmission, when I drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;Manual-ness&#146; of the S Tronic when in &#147;Manual Mode&#148;.  1 - The automatic transmission downshifted when in Manual Mode & I floored the throttle. What I expected was: When in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throttle position.  2 &#150; My commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at WOT were [ ahem ] declined. Completely ignored.  It turns out that I must have pressed right past that &#145;resistance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors I observed. [ I did not know about this &#145;feature&#146; &#150; nor did the Sales Associate, when I questioned him about this. ]  So, this kickdown \ resistance point at WOT actually addresses both my criticisms.  Not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.  With substantial throttle [ essentially WOT, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. And the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. Very quick, but not jarring. Excellent. And almost surreal.  And avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throttle opening. We&#146;re good.  I also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! The behavior I prefer.  So &#150; I&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . But I can live with the current presentation, I suppose.  And there is still one thing I do find somewhat annoying about the trans. At very low speeds, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive smoothly at parking lot speeds.  The rest of the car is impressive, to me: Interior comfort, materials & styling appeal to me. The handling is impressive. The handling feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying. The ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this S4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where I&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s. And the Audi Drive Select Package &#150; that includes the Sport Rear Diff. For European Delivery.  Excellent.  It is remotely possible that the 335iS, with 370 TQ and the performance exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the S4 is at the top of my &#145;short list&#146;. - Ray  [ Note: It appears unlikely that the 335iS will be available for test at a Dealer before this June or July. Sigh. ]"
4301,plekto,February 2010,"I hear you about the odd transmissions. My biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. A great example was when I was test-driving a RX8 a while back. At least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. So leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the brakes).  But when slowing down, it would do odd things. Say, I was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. It would always drop into top gear and then wait. Then when it thought I was at the right speed, select a gear for me. Now, I know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. So a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. What happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the EPA MPG tests). Then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.  It felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller coaster and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are freed from the mechanism) Going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. On the RX8, it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless it's revved up to 3-4K+  It should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. Instead I got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time I hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. Which given the mile high gearing on most cars these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.  Now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. No idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.  BTW, check out the G37. It impressed me."

4303,markcincinnati,February 2010,"The Audi offers, 3 1/2 different modes with the Tiptronic and ADS (D, S and M#1 and M#2, providing the ""1/2"" mode):  D = Drive mode (but you get Drive Comfort or Drive Auto) S = Sport mode (still fully automatic shifting, but you get Drive Dynamic until you exit Sport mode) M = Manual mode #1 - where ""it"" decides how long you stay in M mode; ""it"" decides when to take you back to D mode or S mode if you have used the paddle shifters and were either in Drive or Sport when you used the paddle. M = Manual mode #2 - where it stays where you keep it, unless you slow below ""lugging"" then it will downshif from M6, to MN, where ""N"" is a lower gear based on road speed.  In Manual mode #2, I do not actually know if you were in M4, for instance and pressed the pedal to the metal if it would down shift or not. I thought I had read somewhere that kickdown was either disabled or that you had to push through the resistance (Resistance is Futile -- the Borg!)  So, in D, Auto mode, apparently you get, sometimes, D = Comfort mode and sometimes D = Dynamic (or sport) mode.

4305,slance66,May 2010,"After reading every forum and review known to man, I'm stumped. I'm driving an 07 Tribeca, which has good steering and loads of room, but bad ergonomics and a lousy tranny. My new commute, 3.25 miles each way. To avoid piling miles on my wife's RX350 (yes the Subie was hers, don't ask) I need something I can enjoy driving on backroads, and which my family of 3 can enjoy on long highway drives as much as the RX, with better mileage hopefully. Since I'll put few miles on it, anything with less than 70k on it used is on the table. I'm in New England, with a steep driveway,so RWD is a dicey proposition. Contenders:  07 525xi: Can I find one without idrive? Cupholders? 07 328xi: Same as above? Backseat? Pleather? 04-05 530i: RWD? Cupholders? iDrive? 07 Lexus E350: FWD? Isn't this a Camry? 07 Lexus IS250 AWD: Slow? Backseat a bad joke? 2003 530i: Backseat in this prior generation? RWD? Cupholders? 07 A4: backseat? reliability? 06 A6: reliability? availability? 06-07 MB C class 4matic: reliability, backseat room, mileage sucks for a small car 06 MB E350 4matic: reliability? Price is high. Infiniti M35x: mileage is awful, worse than my SUV Infiniti G35x: tempting, crappy mileage again. Acura RL: wife hated it. Acura TL: ??? New one is hideous. Acua TSX: Too small...glorfied Civic.  A new Mazda 6 almost looks good in comparison. All the above will be post warranty (mostly), paid for with cash."
4306,plekto,May 2010,"(mulls over the data)  The best car for you would be a white 2009 Pontiac G8.(the other colors are ""meh"" and most women want that pearlescent white) Good reliability, low price, handles very well. Overall a great deal for the money that unfortunately GM in its idiocy decided to stop selling.  I drove one and it was about 80% as nice as the previous generation CTS, which is what I'd probably have otherwise recommend. But the fact that you want midsize over luxury and are considering the Mazda 6, plus the G35 means a few years old or certified is also in the consideration... (I get a $25K new/used price range, right?)  It really was an eye-opener. GM as usual, has their second best car aside from the new CTS NOT for sale in the U.S. It's still sold in Australia, and is the #1 car there.  Be sure to get the premium audio but NOT the nav, since that radio/information center is incredible and NAV systems are a waste of money.(just get a portable model for $300) One look at the radio and you'll see that it's the best radio/information center GM has ever built.  Note - the 2007 CTS is also an absolute steal. As the last year of the previous style, it has few reliability issues, looks and handles great, and well, it's under $20K for a certified example. There's probably no better used deal right now that I can think of, especially since in three months, off-lease models will start to appear.(4 years old is the sweet spot for certified/off-lease executive type cars)  No reason to buy now, though. Wait until the 2011 models come out and the used prices go down by several thousand dollars.  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=278774963 This is the V8 model - crazy fun.

If you pause it, the little rectangles on the shelf are the radio presets. It's as idiot-proof to use as it is good sounding.  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=276570829 Expect $20K prices all over town on similar 2009 models in 3 months when they turn two years old.(or 15-16K on a 2008) The V6 is about 2mpg better overall and has 256 hp. It's basically as fast and nearly as agile as the current base model CTS. I found it to be very fast and nearly perfect. But the V8 sound... yeah, I'd sacrifice 2mpg for that... :shades:"

4309,slance66,May 2010,"Well every car on my list is a ""luxury"" brand and this is the entry level luxury form. I mentioned the Mazda only because it seems all around capable. The only GM I've ever owned is a 1970 Cutlass convertible. I have planned on continuing that streak. I find the CTS mostly unattractive, and it was unfortunate that Acura has been copying all the harsh angles. The new LaCrosse is good looking, but I'm just not that old. There is no way a G8 will ever get up my driveway in winter, and the styling? Maybe when I was 15. I'd get a CTS first for sure.  I feel like the default pick is a 3-series, but the run-flat tires don't appeal and the out of warranty service could be a problem. Maybe I should chance the Audi reliability with an A6. It does everything else well."
4310,plekto,May 2010,"The previous generation CTS is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. The pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. YOU might not like the CTS, but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car she's been suffering with.  I know this as my mother is looking for the exact same type of car - and the CTS keeps staying on her top 3 list.   That's a nice car - lighter colors hide the angles a lot.  Look, the simple fact is that anything from BMW, Audi, or Mercedes will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once it's out of warranty. I'm talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a sensor under the hood. You have been warned if you go down that path. And, it's not really luxury to put pleather in a car these days.(no typo - real leather starts typically in the 40-60K+ range) Simply put, if you can't afford it new, these will destroy you financially, used.  **** 07 Lexus E350: FWD?

Acura TL: ??? New one is hideous. Acua TSX: Too small...glorfied Civic. **** Your original list immediately shrinks to this. Lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - I'll get to them in a bit). Infiniti is great. The G37 Journey is fantastic. And, honestly, NONE of the AWD system in cars unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. It's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. So either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a Subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. Or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.  Interesting that you say that the new 2009 TSX is small - it's much larger than the older one and I thought it would be a perfect fit.  Anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. I can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation CTS, let alone something like a G37.  So, the two Lexus exceptions you should look at: The IS300 was perhaps the closest thing Japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small European sport sedan feel. They also are one of the least expensive luxury sport sedans ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. I'd look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. I'd also say the same thing about a 2007 CTS - DRIVE it and then decide if it's bad or not.  The other one is a 2005 Lexus GS300. What makes this car special is that it is RWD and has a 3.0L inline 6 engine. As a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good MPG. There's a reason BMW and uses inline 6 engines, and Lexus got it exactly right with both the IS300 and the GS300(same engine, btw, in both).  Why did they change? They worshiped HP and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. Then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the CTS, which was a real game changer.  Other than that, you're looking at a Volvo or maybe a SUV. The reality is fo rused cars:  Japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly) GM - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally) BMW/Mercedes/Audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock)"
4311,tlong,May 2010,"Disagree that BMW/Mercedes/Audi depreciate like a rock. They actually have really good residuals, as does VW. The driving experience and interiors of these cars raise their values even though the maintenance is high and reliability is highly variable. I've owned VW and Audi and I love the vehicles. I've had pretty good luck with reliability, but you are correct - if you have to pay for the repair it is not going to be pretty.  When I owned an Audi (not THAT bad for repairs and reliability) I wished for a very reliable Japanese car.  Then I got rid of it and bought an Acura TL. I now have a very reliable Japanese (brand) car. And I really long for the Audi!  Pick your poison; I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it."
4312,plekto,May 2010,"I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it.  One car fits that bill, a used IS300. I know, I drove everything, and the only *Japanese* car in your price range that feels like a European model is that one.  Now, domestics have that as well, though reliability is a little less. It's still worlds better than BMW or Audi, though. GM has spent a lot of time testing their cars in Germany lately, and the G8, CTS, and a few others show it. They feel properly ""European"" as well."
4313,slance66,May 2010,"Yes this is exactly my problem! My prior car was a Volvo S60, which was a compromise that fell just short on both counts. Still it was an excellent car for 9 years. Now I'm in a bullet-proof Subaru Tribeca. Build quality is amazing, but I want a sedan again and better than the 23 highway MPG I get with the Tribeca.  As for the CTS mentioned previously, my wife hates them. She has a Lexus RX350, so she's very happy with that. She wants me to get a soul-less Lexus ES350, which she loves. I'm looking for a little more of the European driving experience than that, even a TL would be better. I'm looking at used because I pay cash for cars, never had a payment and I don't want one and because new cars are a rip-off, especially for someone with a 3 mile commute."
4314,plekto,May 2010,"Ah. Bit clearer now.  The G37 sedan is your likely best bet, then. It's big, luxurious(just get the Journey package with the wood trim and NO sport package), and handles far better than your Volvo did. It also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so that's a plus. It's a much more refined car than the G35, which felt like a 4 door Z. IMO, it's critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the Infiniti and TL/TSX and NOT to get the upgraded suspension or tires. The stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.  There is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. The Mercedes C class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break AND get manual as well. Of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. Avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from Mercedes with an automatic.  The gem of course was a 2003-2005 C230K *sedan*. The replacement for it is a tremendous seller in Europe(now C300K, iirc). It gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". But only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy)"
4315,roadburner,May 2010,"A BMW won't be as inexpensive to run as a Honda, but they are nowhere near as expensive to maintain as the urban legends some like to parrot. Since 1983 I've always had one or more BMWs in the garage; I currently own a 1995 3 Series as well as a 2004 X3(and a 1975 2002- but that's a hobby car). The 3er has 121K miles on it and the X3 has 92K miles on the clock. Maintenance and repair costs for both are averaging @5 cents per mile(in the case of the X3, that number is calculated over the 42K miles after the free maintenance plan expired). Non-scheduled repairs on the 3er have consisted of a brake light switch, a thermostat, and the serpentine belt idler pullies. The X3 has required a passenger seat SRS sensor(replaced under warranty). Of the cars you mentioned, I'd take an E39 530i- with the Sport Package, of course. It's a fantastic car; many enthusiasts(myself included) think that it is superior to its E60 successor. As for non BMWs, I'd also take a look at the Mazdaspeed 6. I find the Lexus models to be terribly unsafe; if I drove one I'd almost certainly die of boredom..."
4316,slance66,May 2010,"Yeah G37 looks nice, but is beyond my ""no car payments"" price point, since it's a new model. I drove a G35x, and liked it except that what I'd like even more is a detuned model with 230-240HP and better mileage. The 4 door Z description is right on. Where is the balance? I agree on the wood in the Inifiniti and Acura, the metal looks too ""techno"" and cold, and agree on the suspension and tires. Anything less than an aspect ratio of 55 is way too hard to handle our broken New England pavement without punishing your kidneys.  I don't need Nav...I would opt for it in a Japanese car, as I expect it to be trouble free. I can't get a manual, as my wife can't drive them. So Auto it is, but I like the idea of de-electifying a MB. I really like the 2008+ C class, looks better and the prior version was awfully small in the back. Prices are still high though. Haven't checked the 03-05, but will look at specs. I had the same thought with BMW...a 525xi with no i-drive. I'd rather a nice cupholder than that knob. At least MBs have cupholders."
4317,slance66,May 2010,"roadburner, if I had an indi BMW mechanic nearby, I'd probably put an E39 530i near the top of my list. I've seen several of them for sale, at good prices. Snow tires and wheels would be a definite expense however, for any RWD car. Even then I'd worry about my steep driveway, but a 5 series should have good weight distribution. Are there any known big expenses with those (I assume timing belt...what mileage?)."
4318,plekto,May 2010,"The base G37 starts at almost exactly $30K new(cars direct has one for $30,200 after $1K in incentives!) So used run 4-8K less. The Journey with premium and maple wood accents(2010 only ) is $34,115(advertised street price). So 25K for a 1-2 year old example is possible to find. Yes, it surprised me as well - it seems like a steal at that price.  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=278031393 This is a nice color combo - though it's not the Journey with wood trim and all of that. edit - these two are different shades of blue...  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=272067925 Typical private party price. It's a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. Doubly so since it's the new model. I know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible Maybe it's not required, but it's certainly a feather in their cap if it's new bling vs old bling.  My brain also did a double-take at these prices. If you can wait until September when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25K range.  edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. I can't find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside."
4319,roadburner,May 2010,"No US spec BMW engine has used a timing belt since late 1991. The cooling system is the only major issue. Most owners practice preventative maintenance and replace the water pump, thermostat, and radiator at @100K miles. My indie shop charged me @$1000 to do the work on my wife's 528i back in 2005(it's an easy afternoon DIY job but it was the middle of winter and my wife needed the car pronto). I bought a set of winter tires/wheels and changed them out myself in November and March; the car had no trouble in any sort of winter weather. There's a great E39 group non Yahoo as well as several websites dedicated to the E39. It is just a fantastic car. As a matter of fact, I'm considering picking up a low-mileage E39 M5 for a daily driver/track toy."
4320,plekto,June 2010,"If you look at the tread of a typical AT tire, it's nearly identical to most non-directional all-season car tires. As such, it's worthless in snow and mud and really should be considered the truck equivalent of a street - only tire. Now, for a lot of people, it works fine enough. They see a tiny bit of dirt and some gravel roads every so often. And for their soft-roader SUVs, life is good.  But for snow, you absolutely need mud terrain tires as a minimum. And 4x4 engaged. Also, look for a tread pattern that has lots of sipes in it. The older BFG mud terrains were very bad in rain for this reason(zero sipes anywhere), though good otherwise."

4323,jtla,July 2010,"Thanks for the link to 2011 Volvo S60 T6 AWD. I read it the first time you posted.  The new S60 looks promising. I think its T6 engine power output -- 300 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque -- is among the top of this group, especially the torque. IMO, Volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout. As to handling, we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive.  While this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for Volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. For performance, the 3-series and G37 still lead the pack. For luxurious feels, TL and A4 may have the edge. For dependability reputation, the Japanese brands are always safer bets. For badge shoppers, MB certainly sounds more prestigious. Safety is Volvo's strong suite, but others are not far behind. A Volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment. And its new Chinese ownership doesn't help, either."
4324,sweendogy,July 2010,jtla - yeah that past post is now gone- as is the one above your post- have to play by mr. edmunds rules or else. I agree with you the T6 pretty interesting with all the torque and have to agree its a tough sell in this market giving volvos past efforts in the space and the competitors-- but i do like the fact that they are doing something which intern will make the group better.

4328,kfdmed,July 2010,"Before buying a Maxima. I was purchasing not leasing so that ruled out BMW, Mercedes and the Audi (out of my price range anyway). Lexus does nothing for me. I wanted all-wheel drive for the Cadillac and Infiniti so they were priced out of reach. I didn't much care for the Lacrosse. Came down to the TL and Maxima. I liked them pretty much equally. The fact that the Maxima could be had for about 2k less than the TL, had more features, and that I liked the interior/exterior styling better than the TL sold me. I think the Maxima should be included here."
4329,jtla,July 2010,"Sorry, but as much as I like the Maxima, it does not belong to this discussion. First and foremost, Nissan is not considered a luxury brand. Secondly, Maxima comes in FWD drivetrain with CVT transmission -- not a performance/sport sedan in my book."

4335,fedlawman,July 2010,"Well, none of these cars are ""sports cars."" The question is how much sport do you want. I don't think FWD is a huge disadvantage in this category - 99% of people shopping this segment won't be able to tell the difference.  The FWD TL may be less sporty than a RWD G37, but it is definitely sportier than a Maxima.  I personally agree that the CVT completely eliminates any hope for the Maxima being included in this category. It's seems more like a sportier Toyota Avalon to me..."
4336,smarty666,July 2010,"Excellent topic to say the least, considering I have a 3G FWD TL, a FWD Maxima, the new one, and a RWD Infiniti I think I can add some decent insight on this. I can tell you this, the CVT does take a little away from making the Maxima a true sports sedan, like a G37 or 3-Series, but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. The Maxima is just as sporty as the 4G FWD TL, but FWD in itself does have limitations that RWD obviously and my 3G TL has a more sporty flair to it then the 7G Maxima.  The new Maxima has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and I've been able to keep up with higher powered V6's with both A/T and MT so the power and performance of the Maxima is not hindered by the CVT in the least.  Saying the Maxima is a sportier version of an Avalon is a little bit ridiculous to me. Drive both cars back to back and they are totally different. The Maxima's handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the FWD market, except for say Mazda maybe. I would go as far as to say, that the Maxima is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving dynamics, handling, etc for a FWD sedan without having to spend more money and go into a RWD luxury division vehicle. It is a four door sports sedan, no, the CVT and FWD layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan.  Except for one or two things, the CVT is not as bad as people make it out to be. It takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular A/T and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong  In regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. The Maxima is an oddity and hard to classify. Its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and Nissan in the same sentence and I can understand that. On the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. Everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what.  I've heard people classify the Maxima has followed over the years, ""entry-level luxury sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near luxury sedan."" Pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. It really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat!"
4337,kfdmed,July 2010,"Have any driven the Maxima CVT for any period of time? Driven it in the sport mode? The CVT in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission. I once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a CVT? After using it for a while I understand why they included with the CVT. I drove the base FWD TL and Maxima back to back and dont think the TL is any more ""sporty"" than the Maxima."
4338,smarty666,July 2010,"The 4G FWD TL is less sporty in my opinion then the 7G FWD Maxima, not by much but enough I noticed a difference. The Maxima had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. Your right the CVT in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular A/T.  Now, once you move up to the AWD 6 M/T version of the 4G TL, that the TL becomes sportier than the new Maxima, but the base version is definitely tamer then the new Maxima.  Remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the CVT b/c of what happened with the 1G version of it from 2003-2008. Since 2009, all the Nissan products have the updated 2G CVT which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer problems then the 1G had. Nissan extended the transmission warranty so the CVT for them is here to stay! So far I overall really like the CVT and the fuel econ for 290HP is absolutely fabulous."

4340,slance66,August 2010,"The cars they choose to review are annoying. Almost always a manual transmission, which few Americans buy, almost always the most powerful, top of the line car, again usually a low volume car. Like the CTS-V for example. Do they sell any? I'll see BME 550 and 535 reviews, but none for the much more popular 528. Same with the 335 and 328. They need to test the cars most people will buy, equipped in the way most people will buy them. But instead they can't resist the joy-ride in the more exclusive vehicle. If an automatic makes it into a test, they bash it, b/c of the auto."
4341,rayainsw,August 2010,"A few assertions in posts 11286 & 11287 that I&#146;d like to comment on here.  86 - I read lots of comparisons. I find the test results of use in several ways. Including:  I do not [ ever ] intentionally even approach maximum lateral acceleration limits on any public road. I leave a comfortable margin. But the handling tests that the various publications conduct allow me to judge & compare how high those limits are, and how the vehicle behaves at or near those limits &#150; in case I ever do need to approach them, due to unforeseen events.  Though I very rarely do 0 &#150; 60, I do 40 &#150; 65 regularly, in highway merge situations, and just for fun. And I have developed a reasonably well calibrated &#145;butt dyno&#146; over the years. And I know what published numbers translate to &#145;enjoyable acceleration ability&#146; &#150; for me - and what will not make the cut.  87 &#150; Consumer Reports [ often ] and Motor Trend and Edmunds [ occasionally ] test the lower level variants. My sense is that the other major publications typically focus on the higher performance versions, as that is what the readers of R&T and C+D seem most interested in.  I was quite interested to see the &#145;Short Take&#146; on the C+D web site of the 335iS with DCT &#145;automatic&#146; transmission &#150; as this exact configuration is one of 2 contenders on the &#145;short list&#146; for my hard earned dollars, next year.

Seriously though, I do think they should test the automatic AWD sedans once in while. But to make the tests viable, they need to modify the parameters a little.  Instead of lateral grip, they should measure ability to weave between shopping carts strewn about an Old Navy parking lot.  Instead of comparing acceleration, they should measure which car is easiest to check stock quotes on your iPhone while merging on the freeway.  Instead of testing 70-0 braking, they should test which car has the smallest stains on the floormats when you slam on the brake pedal while sipping a double non-fat mocha latte."

4348,nyccarguy,August 2010,"He actually USED to drive a TSX. He sold it and bought an E30 M3 (no further explaination needed).  The chat is ENTRY LEVEL LUXURY PERFORMANCE SEDANS (not for the Money).  I think it is a fantastic category. Each car is different in its own way. Each car is better in its own way. Different things matter to different people as far as entry level luxury performance sedans go. I'd be happy with most of them.  Yes BMWs do get pricey if you load them up with lots of goodies, but the chassis dynamics & balance of a 3 series (even a 328i) make it WELL WORTH the price of admission. Not only does a 328i handle extremely well, but it also rides comfortably. Tremendous brakes & wonderful steering are 3 series hallmarks. The 3 is a great car for 1 person or if it is a 2nd car, I think personally the E90 sedan is on the small side. There are other costs to consider besides the price paid for the car. BMW includes scheduled maintenance. Check out the prices of CPO 3 series vs. a CPO G. If you've got the time, European Delivery is available for the BMW & now you're talking 335i car for 328i price. The 3 also gets decent fuel economy. 6 Speed stick availability is a BIG PLUS for me.  I have a terriffic service advisor at BMW that treats my family and I like royalty. ""What's that Bradd, your Dad drove over an 2x4 in the snow that busted his radiator on his X5 and he's stopped in the middle of the bridge in a snowstorm? He's OK? Good. Are the dogs with him? You're in the towtruck?"" There were no service appointments available for 4 days and no loaner cars available for at least a week and a half. I drove out of the dealership in an hour with a loaner car which they let me keep for the 3 & a half weeks my Dad's truck was being fixed.  I agree with you that for the money, the G37 is very hard to beat. I've been on Infiniti's ""build your own"" site and my ideal G37S 6 Speed has an MSRP of $39K and change. You can buy the car for what, $36K? I've driven a G37X before. I love the accleration. The car is extremely well balanced & feels like it turns on an axis. The VQ isn't nearly as smooth as the BMW I6 & it guzzles gas (even with a 7 speed automatic). 6 Speed stick availability is a plus for me.  The A4 is a nice car too. Very roomy compared to the 3 & the G. Rides smooth. Brakes don't have the bite of the 3 or the G. Amazingly finished interior, gorgeous materials. A very sharp looking car with the S Line Sports Package. Turbo With 258 lb ft torque & great highway mileage. Even though all the others offer AWD, they offer it because of QUATTRO. My Mom had an '02 A6 and I'm nowhere near impressed with Audi's customer service.  I actually think the IS is a handsomely styled car. LEXUS came so close with the 1st generation IS, that I was disapointed with the second gen version. It has aged well though. The IS350's accleration rivals that of the G37 & 335i. The interior is well finished, beautiful, and very comfortable. The back seat is about as useful as my Prelude's. They do offer some type of Sports Package that supposedly makes the handling razor sharp. There is something to be said about LEXUS reliability too. The IS250's 204 hp V6 is laughable at this price point. Not only is it snail slow, but doesn't get that good gas mileage. 6 speed stick only available on the IS250. Brakes are instant on with ZERO linear feel, but they do stop the car now. I felt the handling to be disconnected.  Say what you want about the TL SH AWD, but it is the only one of these cars that is real sized. Gonna go out with another couple? The other 3 people will vote Acura every day of the week and twice on Sunday. It has a big trunk too. Available 6 speed stick w/ SH AWD makes it very competitive in this segment. Under all the glitz and glamour, it is still a Honda. A big plus for me.  Personally, I've never been a big fan of the C-Class. SO if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. It is a good looking car.  That new Volvo S60 has been getting good reviews (except from Car & Driver).  I think those are the major players."

I owned the G35 when first released...and i liked it; but now (8 years later) after weighing all things the G37 would be on my lower end; of course all vehicles mentioned in this category are nice (nothing really to complain about).  nyccarguy ""The IS350's accleration rivals that of the G37 & 335i. ""  After driving an IS350 for a couple years now I can say it isn't as fast as a G37 or 335i. In an all-out race maybe.  But the torque is really lacking below 4000 or so. The 335i felt like a rocket at any rpm...the G felt strong...but i had the sense that something was going to break in the upper RPM range."
4351,nyccarguy,August 2010,Hmmm - a VW CC 3.6 4Motion? Never thought of that one. Everything I've read says the 2.0T w/ 6 speed stick is the CC to get. I would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation.  What made you switch from the old G35 to the IS350? What made you choose the IS350? Would you buy another one?
4352,sweendogy,August 2010,"HAVE TO AGREE THE VW CC?? for the money you can acually save 3-5k and just get the basic passat..CC maybe a good looking car but its no proformance sedan and it gets real pricy quickly seats only 4 and for the performance its far behind everything in its class.. plus your driving a VW and not a lux brand. -- I would also put the TL into this class a nice car but not a true performer unless you get a 6speed (have not come across one owner here on edmunds).  For those who talk about BMW and its maintainance program..sure its great but really -- i have a 3 year old G with 23k miles on its- -OIL changes and TIre rotations are all that are needed, airfilters and the like-- we are not talking about major service-- I paid 36.5K for a fully loaded G-- the comp a 335 would have cost me over 50k - - I will take my 15k and pay out of pocket any day for service.

4353,nyccarguy,August 2010,"But sometimes price drives your decision more than anything else.  I've always dreamed of that perfect BMW (SP/6SPD/Heated Seats) sitting on a dealer's lot with a drop dead, can't pass it up price attached to it.  I saw an ad in the paper today for a very cheap lease on a C300 with an MSRP of only $35,570 that has a 6 Speed Stick & heated seats, RWD, but not much else. I think if I needed a car right now and could lease, I'd go down there and see how much I can steal the car from them for. Every MB sedan I see around here is 4Matic AWD."
4354,kfdmed,August 2010,"BMW's are butt ugly, ride harsh, and cost a boat load of money to maintain/service (after the free stuff). Their interiors are from the '90's and there exterior design is Korean looking cheap. I would take a TL and pocket the 10 -15k in a heartbeat. The RWD/FWD debate is overrated much like the manual/auto trans debate. Yes I know how to shift gears and work a clutch. Yes I have driven rear wheel cars. No, I am not sixteen anymore and don't care to drive like I am on the autobahn.  The TL/AWD, CTS/4, and G37X are the best choices. The Germans are just ugly/boring and expensive. Why Lexus is on the right I don't know."
4355,tlong,August 2010,Don't know how you can call that post credible when you talk about butt ugly but then like the new TL.  And I'm a TL owner (2005!).  I agree the Bangle BMWs were a styling step backwards. Not real pretty.
4356,ivan_99,August 2010,"""I would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation""  Yeah...I think that motor has been around for 5 years or so; time to upgrade i think. But still not too far behind  I thought about a CC 2.0T and chipping it...making a fun project car. But when they first came out you couldn't get the Nav system (really nice) with a manual. Their auto wasn't the DSG...just a regular 6spd (plus my wife was giving me a hard time about a 4 seater)  I had a few cars between the old G35 and IS350 (I have a problem).  I did a CPO for the IS350. I was looking at CPO'd 335's...coupe. I was scared off by the maintenance stories (the IS has not been perfect...even requiring a tow truck--boost).  I thought the BMW was gorgeous, but didn't care for the interior. The Lexus CPO was better than the BMW and one of the 335's I drove was only auto (i know like the IS ). The manual 335 i drove was a base...again the interior threw me off. Materials and quality were good, it just didn't look right to me (or not as good as others...although i'm tiring of the IS interior...that problem i have) .  An A5 would have been my first choice, but the price got too high (the S5 was a dream to drive---felt like James Bond ). The new A4 wasn't out yet...love the recent Audi's. I really liked the CTS as well; it just didn't feel as good as the others The new MB C was out, but I couldn't find a price similar to the IS's CPO (they were too new) -- it drove similar to the IS.  I probably wouldn't buy another IS today. I get very annoyed by Auto trannies; they never do what i want them to. I can rant even further about the shiftable auto trannies like the IS and CTS (etc)...shift...wait...wait...wait...wait...gear change (if you ever see a grown man screaming at the shift leaver...that is me ) BTW -- Like the DSG  I can't drive the IS in 'normal' mode...i have to leave it in 'power' mode. This alters the throttle response (makes it shift less smooth -- sometimes jerky ). In normal mode I feel like i'm going to loose my mind; think driving a Corolla in the sand.  The traction control comes on WAY too early (this is an 06); I believe they altered it for other years. You can disable the traction control...through an esoteric sequence of brake and parking brake taps...at every startup.  The thing I like the least is the low torque at normal driving speeds. If you squeeze the pedal too slow you're left wondering if something is wrong. You have to learn to tap it just right to get a one or two down-shift.  If you keep the pedal down and past 4K the thing flys; but at this point you're getting into triple digits and you'll need a good layer and a lenient Judge...mommy why's daddy in jail...  During my test drives i was a maniac so I didn't notice the little nuances in 'normal' driving; which I suppose we all have to do at some point  But it's an ok car...I like it...looks nice, interior is fine. Goes fast when I need to. My average mileage is 22ish which i'm content with.  Think my next car will have to be a coupe...or a tunned up turbo something...or both"
4357,cdnpinhead,August 2010,"Thanks for that post.  Lots of interesting comments & insights. I've looked at several of these cars over the years, but don't change up very often myself.  If I had to replace my TSX today, it would probably be with a VW TDI w/ a manual transmission -- hopefully the VW reliability issues have been tamed, at least for your sake."
4358,kfdmed,August 2010,"BMW's overall are not butt ugly. The rear end styling is awful. The rest is pretty good.  I have stated this before that I like the TL's look. I think it gets a bad rap.  As far as looks goes I rate them CTS, TL, G37, 3 series, A4, IS250/350."

4363,plekto,August 2010,"It's going to be Infiniti's answer to the A4 and TSX and the like - entry level luxury for the price *just above* that of a Camry or Accord. Except in this case, it'll be the same price, offer better equipment and options for the money, and be rear wheel drive.(read - out-handle the competition by a large margin)  As for gas mileage, expect roughly 20 city and 30 highway, give or take. Pretty much like all of the 6 cylinder luxury sedans these days. For someone like my mother, who wants a car like the G37 but without the 300+ HP, since she's just using it around town, it's perfect.  EDIT - Japan's site says that the car gets an average of 24mpg combined(converted to US gallons). Pretty much what we expected. 30 highway should be possible."

The G35 has been replaced with G37 since 2009 model year. Now that G25 is unveiled and, given the fact that both IS350/250, 328/335, and TL/TSX are on the list, both G37 and G25 should also be added.  Thanks in advance."
4365,jtla,August 2010,"I think the rpm has little to do with how many gears there are in the transmission, but rather more to do with the ratio of highest gear. Maybe sween can tell us what is the rpm on G35 at 85 mph., but I doubt it would be anywhere near the 4000 rpm as you imagine. I would be very surprised if it was over 3000 rpm."
4366,kfdmed,August 2010,going 65 mph were approaching 3000. So at 85 mph 4000 rpm is probably a bit high but in the ball park. The G37 with the 7-speed trans runs at a considerably lower RPM highway speeds. .

Seems the lease pricing on the new vehicles is not all that great but the concern is maintenance, repair and financing for a 3 year old vehicle.

Called Infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my problems with the fronts, even though I was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors.  Yeah, great customer service! Infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! That is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service list by JD Power!  No matter what automaker, you shouldn't be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. What is sad is that Infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006 G35 and 2003-2006 FX owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR!  We used to have a lot of Nissan/Infiniti in my family, like you did with Honda/Acura and none so far have gone back to Infiniti and replaced them with Acura's, Lexus's, and BMW's."
4383,duke39,August 2010,"I test drove the new TL last year  The torque steer in the TL was so bad that I felt that I affected my control of the vehicle when it was driven aggressively.  The TL tries to portray itself as a performance luxury car but it can never be a performance car with all the torque steer. If you never drive in a sporty and aggressive manner then the torque steer will not matter. But if your hoping to have a fun vehicle to drive, there are much better choices out there.  A car with this much power cannot effectively use the front wheels for steering, handling and delivering power to the front end.  I found the handling way too jittery."
4384,smarty666,August 2010,"I've felt some torque steer but nothing to the dramatic extent your describing. It is easy to compensate for by just having two hands on the wheel when accelerating fast. Its not perfect but its not terrible either. I have the 3G Base so I can only speak for that vehicle. The Type-S had the bigger engine and displacement so I assume maybe that could have more severe torque steer.  One thing I give Nissan credit for in the new Maxima, is they have virtually eliminated torque steer. A pretty impressive feet for a car with 290HP/261 lbs of torque in a FWD set-up. I have felt little to none under brisk acceleration since having it. Can't speak for the new TL since I don't have one if Acura was able to improve upon that compared to the last Gen TL."
4385,2233,August 2010,"smarty 666,  My point was that Infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.  Acura did not. Their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.  This is my experience. Yours may be different. It seems we are both ""car guys"" with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.  Acura is clearly having sales problems with their TL. That is not in dispute. Hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return Acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. Hopefully Acura, Infiniti, BMW, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer cars for their customers.  Loyalty is important to me and my extended family and it should run both ways. I'm sure you feel the same way."
4386,smarty666,August 2010,"Couldn't agree with your last post more! I personally, after seeing first hand how the sales animals treat you, have no brand loyalty. I go where ever I like the vehicles, get the best price, treatment, etc. B/C at the end of the day, there is no brand loyalty. When you walk in to the salesman, no matter how long you've been with them, they treat you as if your there for the first time and try to screw you over. I've had it time and time again with multiple automakers.  I'm sorry to hear Acura was not willing to step up and back you up. Its quite a shame. I had the same experience with Infiniti not stepping up and helping me so I guess we were the victims of the same mistreatment, just by different companies!  It is a shame with the sales figures of the new TL. I too was turned away from getting one, b/c of the size increase and ugly grill, hence why I got a new Maxima, so hopefully they get the message on that one and the next gen TL will be back on track. So far, my Maxima has been fun to drive, and after 12k miles, I'm happy to say, no rotor/brake issues like I have on my FX35! Its a good thing for the class action lawsuit so that all my brake/rotor fixes were covered b/c that would have added up quickly and really hurt the bank.  I'm glad, though I can't understand why it took Nissan and Infiniti over 5 years to finally put the proper type of brakes and rotors on their vehicles, that they finally have had their brake/rotor issues solved. Before 2009, it was a really serious problem on both Infiniti and Nissan vehicles. I know the 2007 and 2008 Altima's had major troubles with wear as well, but so far, since 2009 model years, I've read very few brake/rotor issues compared to years previous!  It only goes to help us!"
4387,2233,August 2010,"I really like the new Maxima. It resembles the M37 a great deal. I didn't test drive one when searching for a car for my daughter since it was priced higher than the Altima but it's alot less expensive than the M37.  Infinti's brake issues existed from 2003 to 2006 in the G. They changed the design and the pad for the 2007 model and no problems with my wife's 2007. I'm not up to speed on the FX though.  I'm looking for a new car in 2011 or 2012. I think the FX is the best looking SUV ever made but some find it not attractive.  Speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a Camry last week also. The salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a Toyotal Supra back in the 90s. He knew that I was an informed consumer.  When we spoke about price, I mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. He first said he never heard of ""holdback"" and when I chuckled he later said Toyota only pays $200 for holdback. I corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.  We walked out. You'd think that an experienced Toyota salesman would have more sense and class but I guess I give some car salemen too much credit."
4388,ctl,August 2010,"A potential TL buyer here. I would think the TL auto trans. issue is history by now, after all, they have been on the same 5 speed all these time! one would think... I wish for the new 6 speed but is a bit worried, almost everyone (benz 7, infiniti 7, toyota 6, has had issue with their newer version of auto trans when it first came out.  Funny all the bittering on infiniti brake pad... now all the issues with 2008-2009 Accord brake pads (consistantly short lived, avg. 20K) makes me wonder about the TL brake pads. Haven't heard much about it yet, but watching closely."
4389,2233,August 2010,"I would wait until the current body style of the TL is out for at least 4 years to assess the potential transmission issues.  Remember, the 2000 + TLs took about 4 years to manifest themselves as did the MDX."
4390,tlong,August 2010,Is the current TL transmission the same as in the '04-'09 models?
4391,sweendogy,August 2010,"comments on CR reliability charts and dealership experinace==  On consumer reports-- I use them for almost everything I buy, from Toasters, Tvs and cars-- i think its a great paid service that does have merit. The break and transmission issues on both the tl and infiniti-- its all about luck when getting a car - most cars have something thats going to be problem (or reported as a problem by the owners)-- no one builds a perfect car (but the accord/civic have been close).  On dealerships-- well i''ve owned both acura and infiniti.. Acura has a better overall setup and you feel wanted when you drop your car off -(2 dealerships i've visited, for oilchanges only, dam i miss the GS-R)- this is my Infiniti -- well i bought my G35 at a small dealership in the middle of nowhere and they have great service but the larger in-town dealership is cold, mass marketed, non-user friendly monster. I think its more about who owns the dealership and where its located."
4392,smarty666,August 2010,"As far as I know, the brake/rotor wear issues are mostly contained to the 2008-2010 Accord. I haven't heard similar problems with the 2009+ TL which I believe uses different pads/rotors from the Accord. Don't quote me on that since I don't have the new TL and not sure what was changed or not changed. But I know that current gen Accord owners are going through hell with Honda on the brake/rotor issues and Honda has not done a great job of stepping up and helping people until being forced to legally or with severe pressure from corporate Honda. Such a shame.  From my own experience, both my 2006 and 2008 TL have had absolutely no brake/rotor issues at all."
4393,billyperks2,August 2010,"2009 TL AWD- 1 year and 1 week of ownership, absolutley no brake or rotar issues."
4394,ctl,August 2010,"The current TL auto-trans 5speed is the same one Honda used across the board (RL, TL, Accord, Civic...), since 2000 TL! On one hand they would probably have made it to perfection by now. On the other, one would think they have extincted by now, lagging behind virtually the whole industry in the transmission area! Amazing stubbornness or confidence? :mad: maybe also they were bite hard by the early trans. issue and being cautious.  As to the brake pad, if I have to bet, I would take that they share the design and parts with Account, at least the FWD version. Will be great if they didn't, but the jury is still out on this one."
4395,sweendogy,August 2010,"ok, good stuff.. i would hope not its a year old-- how many miles >?"
4396,Kirstie_H,August 2010,"That is actually my major complaint with my G35 - it chews through brake pads & rotors more than any other vehicle I've owned.  Of course my major complaint at the moment is that it handles so poorly in the snow, but I knew that when I bought it. I just didn't have a lifestyle then that made it matter."
4397,smarty666,August 2010,"I know exactly what your going through kristie and I feel for you. Its such a shame b/c except for the brake/rotor issues, my FX35 has been flawless and such a blast to have and drive!  Luckily, all the repairs were covered under warranty by Infiniti, after the lawsuits of course, but so far, since 2009, I've read very few complaints from G and FX owners having brake/rotor issues. For 2009, Infiniti put different pads/rotors on which so far looks like solved the problems from 2003-2008 model years.  Wish it didn't have to take that long but it is what it is. Sad to see Honda is doing the same thing to its Accord customers now!"

4401,nyccarguy,September 2010,"Tonight on the Merritt Pkwy, I definitely could have used one of these fine ELLPS we so politely debate about. My 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH's handling prowess is well documented. However, it definitely lacks in the power department compared to most cars of today. I was outgunned, outrun, and almost flat out ran over. Driving well above the posted speed limit in the left lane with cars in front of me (I NEVER tailgate), there was a G37 Coupe riding very close behind me. I was able to move right, left, and then right again. I knew I couldn't hold him off, so I stayed right and let him pass.  While trying to keep the G37 in my sights, I was trying to pass a Lexus RX350 and he just kept gunning it on the straights.  A G37S sedan or Acura TL-SH AWD would have suited me just fine."

4407,gbosil,September 2010,Fed... I love Acura! I am a big fan of the brand and think it's the most cutting edge as far as Design and Technology! Best Bang for your buck! I especially like that there arn't too many on the road! BMWs are now a dime a dozen... can't stand them! Way over priced and too costly to repair! Once that 50K warranty runs off GOOD LUCK! Bend over for the mechanic! :P  Sween... I second getting the E63 AMG Mercedes! Hopefully will own one some day when I am old and gray.. because that's prob the only way I will be able to own one!!! Gas and Insurance alone is a fortune!! :P
4408,fedlawman,September 2010,"I agree there are a lot of 3 series BMW's on the road, but I wouldn't call them overpriced. You can buy a 335i for less than you spent on your TSX.  As for reliability and cost of repairs, I wouldn't say a BMW 3 series will cost any more to own than an Acura. BMW's have their fair share of problems, but Acura isn't exactly known for their robust clutches, transmissions, or brakes. And let's not forget about poor paint quality, interior rattles, and failing radio/nav screens."
4409,billyperks2,September 2010,You have to be joking-unreliability and BMW are like peas in a pod. Go check out the BMW forum- I think I saw one poster returning his 2011 5 series.
4410,smarty666,September 2010,"I agree, that BMW can be had a price similar to many Acura models, BUT, and this is big BUT, at the same price, the BMW is lacking many features and technology the Acura comes with at the same price. If you load up the 328 say with the same technology, features, and equipment that a tech package TSX comes with, the Bimmer is going to be a few thousands more.  Thats just the way it works out. Mercedes is the same way as BMW once loaded up with the same equipment, tech, etc as a loaded up Acura is. They both are going to cost more. And people pay that by the droves, except for Lexus, MB and BMW have the highest luxury sales b/c people flock to them because of their ridiculous prestige badge, despite having to spend more money to get that in their BMW or MB then for the same stuff in a Acura, Infiniti, or Lexus for a few to several thousand dollars less."
4411,bimmer4me,September 2010,this can be said about all automobile manufactures one way or another...check out the 2011 Hyundai forum.
4412,shipo,September 2010,"It's no joke. Like it or not, believe it or not, BMWs are typically very reliable over the long term. That the brand spanking new 5-Series has a very specific teething issue with the steering control software (which causes a pull to the right and has caused a number of folks to ask BMW to buy the car back) is A) not surprising given that it is a first year model, and cannot be used as a metric to bolster your argument that BMWs aren't reliable.  FWIW, I've had two BMWs and driven them for a combined 150,000 miles. The single unscheduled service event that I've ever had was a burned out taillight. Sounds pretty reliable in my book."
4413,tlong,September 2010,"Thats just the way it works out. Mercedes is the same way as BMW once loaded up with the same equipment, tech, etc as a loaded up Acura is. They both are going to cost more. And people pay that by the droves, except for Lexus, MB and BMW have the highest luxury sales b/c people flock to them because of their ridiculous prestige badge  While I agree with a lot of what you say, your implication in the bolded text is not entirely correct. There are reasons that those badges have certain reputations. As a former Audi owner and a current Acura owner, I can tell you that the Acura has been a LOT more reliable than the Audi. But do you know what? I MISS the Audi. It inspired more passion as its interior was nicer, its handling was better, and it was more solid. But it was less reliable and cost a lot more to fix. Sit in a Mercedes and then sit in an Acura. Can you feel the difference? I can. (and no, I've never owned a MB). Different people have different preferences. Some might want reliability or more tech gadgets. Others might want better leather or a more solid feeling or a better handling drive. There are real reasons why people pick things, not only for prestige."
4414,jimbres,September 2010,"I have an '01 BMW 330i that I bought new in June of that year. Since the factory warranty ran out, in June 2005, I've spent a grand total of $1200 on unscheduled repairs. (Most of that went toward replacing a control arm, after I drove into the biggest pothole on the East Coast. Can't really blame that on the car.)  That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee.  You'll find that the 3-series is a very reliable car, particularly when it's equipped according to God's wishes - with a stick."
4415,billyperks2,September 2010,Agree.
4416,nyccarguy,September 2010,"About BMWs being unreliable and expensive to fix/maintain is just plain absurd. Not every car is perfect. For heaven's sake, my brother in law's Civic just had to have the engine replaced after it overheated, oil started gushing out from underneath it, and ceased (he's fanatical about preventitive maintenance). Should he go into the Civic forum here on edmunds and say how unreliable they are.  Yes, Acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. But the TSX is cheaper because it is built on a FWD Honda Accord chassis. A 3 series is built on a dedicated RWD platform which is more expensive to build & design.  Yes some people buy BMWs, MBs, Audis, Lexuses, Infinitis, Acuras... for the badges, but there are many who do drive them because there is a noticable difference in the steering, the brakes, the handling, the responsiveness."
4417,smarty666,September 2010,"I wasn't trying to make it out that prestige was the only reason but in regards to BMW and MB, when they are similarly equipped/packaged to their Acura, Infiniti, or even Audi counterparts are chosen a lot for the prestige factor for those thousands of dollars extra. For many, its not the only reason as you pointed out. For BMW, it could be for a combo of prestige and sport performance/dynamics as to why they chose their vehicle or say for a MB it could be a combo of prestige and luxury comfort.  Personally, Audi to me, has sales similar still to Acura and Infiniti in quantity but even Audi is different from MB and BMW in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you don't have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. But then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker.  I've found out recently over the years, customer service at the dealership and headquarter levels is coming into a sales factor for me because some of the companies are terrible where as others are great."
4418,sweendogy,September 2010,From the sales numbers it doesn't look like many people are buying acuras at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. I think for 75% of these cars (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so I think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are looking at used. Most come with 4yr earrantee. Most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group. I think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. A 40k BMW 335 is not going to give you the same options as a TL but will give you better performance. It's all what your looking for - performance or convenience. On a side note I think audi a4's are way overpriced for size and performance.
4419,roadburner,September 2010,"That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee.  My 1995 3 Series has 121,000 miles on it and the cost of scheduled maintenance and repairs(including four sets of summer/track rubber) averages a bit under 5 cents per mile. As for my wife's 2004 X3 2.5, at 101,000 miles the sole unscheduled repair has been a bad passenger SRS sensor- which was replaced under warranty. Maintenance costs are again averaging @5 cents per mile, and that takes into account the fact that I change the oil and filter twice as often as the SI system calls for. I better be looking for a good Chapter 7 attorney... :P In contrast, my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 has 64,000 miles on it and it has needed a LF strut, a turbocharger, and a VVT Actuator- all before it hit 50,000 miles."
4420,smarty666,September 2010,Infiniti knows that as well so I would assume there will be incentives on the G25 bringing a fully loaded one to be less than a G37 once incentives are applied to that vehicle. I don't think Infiniti is stupid enough to charge full msrp on a G25 when a G37 with incentives costs just about the same.  I think the range of prices is $30-$34 thousand. It will be interesting to see how many loaded ones will be on the lots compared to mid-level trims.
4421,edwardsf,September 2010,"Interesting post. A lot of strong conclusions claiming ""fact"" without any data, even opinion surveys.  I bought a 3 series recently after owning an A4, and a couple of Saab 900s. I bought these previous cars after testing TLs and G35s. I certainly thought the Japanese cars were as good looking and I liked the idea of owning a less blingy, more reliable car. But I like the road feel of the European cars so I bought the Euromobiles even though they did not have as many standard toys. I never tested a Bimmer in these 3 shopping trips because I think there has been a stigma or stereotype of a haughty jerk that is connected with Bimmer drivers. So, for me at least, the BMW image was a turnoff.  But I have a hearing loss and now need a quieter car. So I tested more cars this time, including the A4, TL, CC, IS, ES, and the C300. And the 3 series, even though I think the 328 sedan is the least attractive of all these cars, especially the gorgeous C and G. Not only was the 3 series quieter than all but the land yacht ES, it handled better than the C300 and the A4. It handled much better than the TL, ES and IS. The G37 had similar handling. And the 328 had better ergonomics for a 6-3 guy and better highway gas mileage/emissions than all the other cars.  As another poster mentioned, the 328/325 has better Consumer Reports repair ratings than A4 and C300 and the same ratings as the Japanese cars, except for the land yacht. I bought a three year used 328i for about 50% off original MSRP. I got over the image. The bad one that is."
4422,smarty666,September 2010,"Again, no body looks at all the post and picks and choose what they want to nit pick on; It is a FACT, German automobiles cost more than their Japanese counter parts with the same equipment, etc. I'm not saying nor did I say that was a bad thing, its just the way it is.  All I ever mentioned was the word prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales. I did say that was not the sole and only reason that people buy German vehicles but many on here seem to have missed that. I even mentioned BMW performance/handling as a key factor in conjunction with the BMW badge as reasons why they are so successful.  You as well have strong conclusions claiming ""facts"" about the 3-Series without any data. Don't get me wrong, the 3-Series is a great car but, it doesn't have better city or highway gas mileage then all those other vehicles you test drove and I find it hard to believe it has the best ergonomics for a tall person considering there are other vehicles in that class with more front headroom then the 328 where when your taller, headroom makes the most difference. Not saying the 3-Series is a bad car, it certainly has several pros over some of the other entry-level lux sedans but not in those areas you mentioned.  328i 19/28 mpg (F/R Headroom 38.5''/37.5'') G37 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 39.1""/37.2"") A4 22/30mpg (F/R Headroom 40.0''/37.5'') C300 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 37.1''/36.9'') TL 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 38.4''/36.7'') IS250 21/30mpg (F/R Headroom 37.2''/36.7'') ES350 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 37.8''/37.0'')  I'm not saying I only get Japanese luxury vehicles because that couldn't be further from the truth. I've had Acura, Infiniti, Mercedes, and a Caddy so far. Unless Acura changes direction, I'll most likely be shopping Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, and Audi the next time around."
4423,murphydog,September 2010,"every thing you just described here also related to buying an Acura over a Honda or Hyundai or Nissan....  Find that you like your Acura - but wow, talk about the kettle calling the pot black..."
4424,sweendogy,September 2010,"edwards i agree about the facts statement-- poor job in this and other TL related chats getting real facts. For a laugh read the 2009 + TL chat room-- its full of how fast the TL is verse other cars, how it handles, and other fluff pieces (im banned from that chat) - Fact the 3 series (no matter what the stigma or price) is still the standard in the entry level lux group.. I think its a fantastic car myself and would of bot one but decided the extra 10-15k (i have a G35x) wasnt worth it (vs 335xi) for my needs. I think all cars in this group are good choices... but for performance its 3 series (335) then G from there you go down the line (in no particular order) and its prob IS350, 328, TLAWD, C350, and Catty 3.6.. and further down the line is (no order again) A4, CC, sabb, IS250, ES350, TL Fwd, TSX, g25, caddy 2.8, suzuki.."
4425,smarty666,September 2010,"while that is true, Nissan, Hyundai, Honda, etc are not luxury companies so its puzzling why they would be brought up here; any luxury company in this country is going to have more prestige or what ever you want to call it from the mainstream parent company.  I like the Acura I have, but nothing really from their current product line. That is not new news and not the first time I've mentioned it on here."
4426,edwardsf,September 2010,"Easy now. The main message you have been communicating in many of your posts is the following: ""prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales."" And over and over. But... you cite no data to support that oft repeated claim. That is my point. Not the other strawmen you bring up.  And what exactly is a ""strong"" conclusion? I made some statements such as the ergonomics are better for a 6-3 guy than the other cars. Um, okay. I got in the cars and moved the seats around. I fit in the BMW much better than any of the cars, including the A4, which I actually owned. So, the manufacturers specs are relatively meaningless. For all its warts, CR does try to deal with the manufacturer discrepancies by trying to compensate for them. But even CR does not account for sloping roof tops, which hinder vision. I take it you don't have that issue of being a big guy ....  Which brings us to big highway mpg. Thanks for all your googling of stats but I don't think they help this conversation, the point of which is to share experiences and go beyond the manufacturer and EPA dynometer specs. If you look on fuelconomy.gov or at Edmunds self reporting responses, BMWs get remarkable highway mileage - and mind you, these are BMW drivers who drive fast. The 328, 528 and even 535/335s are almost legendary for getting 29-33 mpg going 70 mph. I averaged 29 mpg going from SB to SF doing about 72 mph. Sure, these are self reporting and anecdotal but the number of them certainly helped convinced me and my experience confirmed them. Again, that is what these forums are for.  Also, your mpg numbers use 2 pretty suspect models. The A4 FWD, which is [non-permissible content removed] due to the fuel saving CVT and the slow, remarkably cramped, Toyota-like IS250.  BTW, my post starts off referencing your apparent mission (BMWs are for prestige hungry wannabees) but mainly, I just wanted some buyers to take a look at my personal experiences. Have a glass of wine or something (after you drive that nose heavy TL, that is....)"
4427,edwardsf,September 2010,"Yes, performance wise, the G and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest. I did not test the higher end 335, IS350, C350 or TLAWD as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all, except the 335 was pretty bad. I don't need AWD.  So we all have our own needs, which puts us into different markets. I had never thought about it before but the TL drivers do seem to be a bit combative. I think this thread has a huge TL vs. G battle in past years. I actually like both cars (I considered both in 2 car purchases) and think that many people would be happy with either. I think the G and 3 Series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while, I pine for a slightly smoother car - maybe like a TL or C300. I never pine for a GM, Suzuki or Toyota...."
4428,sweendogy,September 2010,smarty you just got worked.. lets hope billy posts something quick to cover this page up..
4429,smarty666,September 2010,"I find it laughable that when I do post actual facts and stats that do not support inaccurate claims of the 3-Series superiority in CERTAIN areas, like mpg for instance, excuses are used as to why those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the 3-Series or puts them down regardless; the 3-Series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class and just about matches the competition at best: though the 3-Series is most likely the best in the category for acceleration, handling, and performance oriented capabilities; each vehicle has advantages and disadvantages to its competitors, it just depends on what fits your needs and wants the best;  what disappointing now is that I have provided stats which are simply brushed off as not being able to go by what the manufacturers of their OWN vehicles put out so whats the point of providing stats if they are just going to be dismissed; it seems hypocritical and a waste of my time then  anyone today can beat window sticker EPA estimates in real world experiences and I've done it on my last 5 vehicles so that means that under ideal driving conditions and location any of those entry-level lux vehicles can be exceeded in those numbers on real world conditions or lowered if conditions are not ideal  apparently by saying that a lot of BMW and MB sales are due to the prestige factor has offended some or they would not be making a big deal of it. I have said before there is nothing wrong with that and I'm not trying to put them down based on it; BMW, MB, and Lexus would not be where they are if it was not for a long, proud, prestigious history in this country and they have rightly earned that reputation; maybe it all has to do with the word ""a lot"" - maybe it would have been better to say ""some"", I don't know.  apparently I'm some Acura fan boy who hates all German vehicles; he must of miss the part when I said I've had a MB before and I'm planning on shopping German the next time around; I must be shopping on the prestige factor as well then :P"

You then supplied the data for headroom. Huh? Then I refute your data by stating that manufacturer space spec discrepancies are well known and you sound like I took your candy away.  Please try reading the actual posts and responding to the actual text of the posts. It make the thread go better. For instance, if I say the 328 has better highway mpg than the other cars in its class, you are not responding to that statement by saying ""the 3-Series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class."" That is what is called a strawman. Since you do it repeatedly, I doubt I can convince you to stop but I will try anyway. I did not refer to overall fuel economy as city mpg was not important to me in my purchase. I, like a lot of other people, drive very little city miles as I walk or ride my bike to work.  If I say that the cars you selectively posted are not a good representation of the 328 competitors, you are not responding to my post by saying ""those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the 3-Series or puts them down regardless."" First, I don't know what the heck that sentence means and second, my statement stands unrefuted. But if you want putdowns, here is one for you: the IS250 is blingy Scion tC. Please don't compare it to the 3 series.  Also, I agree that no one cares about one's anecdotal experiences in beating the EPA numbers. However, people do seem to care about the dozens of reports from owners that could amount to some cumulative evidence about the real world operation of the vehicle that they are considering. (The EPA numbers are helpful for emissions though.)  I do agree with one line in your post: ""apparently I'm some Acura fan boy who hates all German vehicles;"""

4434,plekto,September 2010,"My real issue with the 3 series is that it's now a seriously overweight and misguided vehicle when you compare it to its roots. It just is a very fancy and plush ""sedan"". Now, it might be among the best in its class, but that's a lot like the ""class"" that includes cars like a Camry and Accord. Being the best of bland isn't what I want. And neither is ""overweight and boring euro sedan"".  If you want a real sport sedan experience, you need three components(manual is a given): 1 - RWD 2 - Inline engine, preferably an I-6 or turbo 4 180-200HP minimum. 3 - curb weight under 3000lbs. Preferably 2800.  Nothing on the market fits this, though a few coupes and roadsters do. But just under 3600lbs is entirely in the wrong universe."

FWIW #1, the 2011 328i weighs in at 3,362 pounds, only 165 pounds more than my 1999 328i. Not too shabby.  FWIW #2, the last time a 3-Series sedan with an I6 engine weighed 3,000 or less was 1991 (although the 1992 tipped the scales at 3,021 lbs.).  FWIW #3, given that the MUCH more capable 2011 328i weighs only 341 pounds more than the 1992 325i, I think BMW did a pretty good job at packaging all of the new safety requirements, structural integrity and extra size. Personally if I was given the option of the 1992 or the 2011, I'd choose the 2011 every time (although I would almost immediately chuck the RFTs in favor of a good set of GFTs, a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car).

As people have pointed out, even the more troublesome 335/535s have few well below average marks besides the stereo and heater or something.

4449,ivan_99,October 2010,"I would agree that people buy just for the prestige.  A vehicle or manufacturer with prestige would be: ""standing or estimation in the eyes of people : weight or credit in general opinion""  So, for the most part a vehicle/manufacturer has to EARN that prestige...when we go test drive we determine if they live up to it.  So, some people are lazy...they look at a vehicle's reputation (prestige)...and buy.  One vehicle may have a reputation for being sporty...another for reliability.  Buying a vehicle because it has a reputation for reliability is no more noble than buying a vehicle because it is sporty or luxurious. I know our CEO and CIO both purchased their Lexus LS's because it is ""supposed"" to be reliable...they didn't do exhaustive test drives or pour over long term reliability reports.  I currently own a Lexus. I didn't buy it because of it's prestige...I actually prefer many VW's models over Lexus.  Way back, I drove a late 90's (maybe 2000) 3 series...think 323 and was disappointed. I thought ""I was expecting more..."". I drove an ES300...and thought a VW Jetta was far superior.  Difficult thing about a reputation is it's hard to change quickly. People still flock to Toyota (If I hear bullet proof in reference to Toyota reliability again I'll put a bullet in my head...well maybe not...but I'll be really annoyed).  Audi has a bad reputation for reliability; the ones I've owned were less trouble than the Lexus or Honda's I've owned...although non of them were ""bad"".  It's all good"

Wow talk about limited attention spans, you actually were talking about EPA mpg discrepancies/inaccuracies now your complaining about space figures. Give me a break, your so full of it you'll say and do anything to prove your 3 year old 3-Series is Gods gift to man. It does not have the best highway mpg nor the most room of the entry-level lux sedans in its class. Get over it. Great, EPA figures are completely inaccurate and most people can get even better than that if they want to so if others vehicles can get better than their EPA then that means they still can get better mpg then the 3-Series since they are rated higher to begin with. Just because you and few dozen or few hundred sample size of the 3-Series have gotten great mpg doesn't mean all the hundreds of thousands of 3-Series owners are and thus proves nothing.  You make yourself look ridiculous that when I post actual stats to disprove your grandiose claims you spend all your time squirming around it by ""oh this is inaccurate, that is inaccurate, oh you can't go by this, me and a bunch of other people got this, etc. Excuse, excuse, excuse!

I'm not saying there is anything wrong with these facts. There are many reasons to getting German over Japanese, mechanical and performance characteristics being just one, but if someone knows those 3 facts mentioned above and still chooses the German luxury vehicle over the Japanese luxury vehicle then some are making the decision based on some factor other than financial reasons or just sport performance, luxury features, etc. Its because of the name and brand definition of BMW and MB. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. That was part of the reason I got my MB those years ago You can give a name to what ever that factor/reason is, I call it prestige.

4461,nyccarguy,October 2010,"for different folks.  Every single one of these cars has pluses and minuses to different people. For the longest time I've actually favored handling and driving dynamics over raw power and torque.  Maybe I'm getting older & the fact that I live in CT where the entrance ramps on The Merrit Parkway are short and have STOP signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. My 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH handles brilliantly. However, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 RPM (7500 RPM redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 RPM, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. Even my wife's 4cyl TSX feels like it has more pickup. I'm not in the market now because I just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. Plus I think we're going to try and ditch the TSX next year to get wifey an SUV of some sort (she misses her '07 X3).  So if she gets an SUV, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. Just as long as it has LATCHes for the car seats so I can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). In my new home,I'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.  I believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, ABS), I can rock a RWD sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as I do with my Prelude).  The G37S is priced right, has gobs of power, and I'm really impressed with how it handles. I've only driven an AWD G37X, so I can only imagine how well the S handles.  BMWs are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. I love the way the E90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. I've only owned new cars in my life since I passed my driving test at 16 (I'm only 34 now), but I will totally consider a CPO N55 powered 335i in the future.  Like I said before, the Lexus IS350 appeals to me. I like the styling, the interior is very well finished I'm sure, They now offer an F Sport version of the IS which I'm sure sharpens the handling. I went to Lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as I once thought. But no stick shift available on the IS350 kills me. I know there is a stick offered on the IS250, but that car has the pickup of a Corolla. At least the slushbox AWD version I drove did. The brakes are impossible to modulate. There is NO way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series.  I keep my cars for a while. Going on 9 years with my '01 Prelude (bought new as a leftover in April '02). We'll see what happens when the time comes."

4465,shipo,October 2010,"You beat me to it.  Funny thing; I live in a rather hilly part of (often) snowy New Hampshire and I have yet to understand why so many folks ""need"" AWD. I mean geez, unless you have a driveway like my 'cross the street neighbor (a driveway that rises more than 100' over a distance of about 250'), I feel that the extra weight of an AWD system can actually lead to a less safe vehicle when it's slippery out there. ""Less safe?"" Some might question. Yes, less safe. Why? Because the extra weight will, if anything, lengthen stopping distances and reduce the already diminished capacity for a quick maneuver.  FWIW #1, when we moved up here I had a 530i SP, and after the first quarter inch snow fall I promptly ordered a set of winter wheels and tires; they in turn transformed my 5er from a car that couldn't make it up my driveway (only a 9% grade), to a car that could easily reel in AWD and 4WD vehicles in rutted snow up to about 7"" deep (beyond that my car would turn into a snow plow, causing me to simply stay home or leave it at home in favor of a set of cross-country skis).  FWIW #2, the neighbor I referred to above has a winter tire shod Audi A6 Quattro, and as often as not, when the snow flies I see his car either parked down by the street, or stuck kinda sideways some distance up above the road. Said another way, even AWD isn't all it's cracked up to be on really steep slopes."

4467,ivan_99,October 2010,What kind of mileage do you get?  I had an 03 G35 and would see about 21mpg or so. This was mostly highway (70-80%).

4468,smarty666,October 2010,"no, I didn't say they were ending the G they will be due for a redesign on the G model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2G.  I wouldn't get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. Like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and Infiniti even has trouble selling them in the G37 so most are not going to want the manual in a G25 and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. The TSX does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking. Yes the option is nice to have but Infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive G37 as a sales ploy so you never know. Maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.  The 3G G models are just around the corner and I'm eagerly anticipating what Infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. I'm interested to see what influence MB is going to have on the next gen G engine since Nissan/Infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with Diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions!"
4469,smarty666,October 2010,"Well I can't speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but I know from multiple bad winter storms here in NJ over the years, that with my FX, I was all over the road with just the RWD. I tried driving numerous times without the AWD and II was scared for my life. Even doing 10-20mph below speed limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. Once I engaged AWD the vehicle felt planted to the road and I stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle.  Everything I read to this day still says AWD is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and I concur with my own personal experience.  To me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between AWD and RWD so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. Personally, I like that Infiniti has AWD option and not AWD all the time like Subaru and others. This way, 85% of the year I can use just the RWD with better fuel economy and just use AWD when I need it specifically.  If there is ice on the road forget AWD or any drive for that matter. When there is ice on the ground nothing can help you."
4470,jimbres,October 2010,"Shipo's point is that with the right tires - dedicated winter tires - one can safely drive an RWD car on snow-covered roads. Did you switch to dedicated winter tires, or were you using all-season tires when you tried to drive in RWD mode in snowy conditions?  If the latter, then you really weren't addressing Shipo's point."

4472,smarty666,October 2010,"I didn't realize he was referring to winter tires so that is my bad. If that is what he was making then maybe with really excellent quality winter tires you could get away with just RWD.  You are right, I had all season tires on the vehicle since I don't have the extra money lying around to go buy a second set of tires just for winter driving. I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. Just my personal preference."
4473,fedlawman,October 2010,"""The TSX does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking.""  The TSX is available with a 6-speed MT - one of the best on the market."
4474,fedlawman,October 2010,"""I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year.""  Spending several thousand dollars on AWD that you only use on occasion (and hurts performance the other 9-10 months) is a much better idea... :confuse:"
4475,sweendogy,October 2010,"tsx does come in manual--and has since they started making the car..and has pretty sweet throws. On TSX sales not tanking, i would like to see the numbers.  The reason infinti offers a manual is to compete with the BMW 3 but- i guess research shows that the lower 328 sells most cars as autos which for me is a shame. I need a g37x 6 speed.  and on the diamler partnership I agree I hope they keep the nissan 3.7 (or do they go to 4.0) - it might be loud and offers less mpgs but its a pure beast"
4476,shipo,October 2010,"You can't afford a set of winter tires but you can afford to buy AWD? Uhhh, what did I miss?  FWIW, the winter tires paid for themselves, and then some. Consider the following: - I had the 530i for three winters before I turned it in at lease end. - The winter wheel/tire set cost me $1,005. - At lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than BMW Finance's minimum, and as such I didn't need to buy a new set of summer performance tires; cost (then): ~$900 installed. - After the 5er was gone I sold the winter wheel/tire set for $500.  Long story short, not only did I not pay a fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollar up charge for AWD, I made $395 by spending the $1,005 on the winter wheel/tire set. Kinda like found money."
4477,edwardsf,October 2010,"Hmm, what is this ""agree"" thingy? Well, okay, I will run with it.  Regarding ground clearance, I have the same issue with getting in and out. My A4 avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the Audi's seats were just a smidgen lower. This meant I used my back much more getting out of the Audi than I do now with the Bimmer. So make sure you try them all in various packages.  BTW, the Bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the A4 sport. Of course, the Quattro sticks better due to AWD but the Bimmer's steering is just sublime. I truly think the Audi is the balance between the Bimmer and the Mercedes.  I also felt that the Infiinty drove heavier than all three German cars. The G almost reminded me of an American muscle car. NB, I only drove used (2007-8) models. But since cars don't seem to get lighter, I think the Germans are probably more nimble feeling than the Infinity.  Regarding my other infirmity, I have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. The Germans win again, especially the C300 and the 3 series. The new A4 was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. Also, the Lexus were pretty quiet.  That said, I like almost all these cars on the list on the right. The only exceptions are the Caddy, which just seems gauche and the cramped, slow IS250. They all have their strengths and cars are really just better now."

Lows: Road noise, wind noise, engine noise that lacks the manners expected at nearly $$$$$ large.  The Verdict: Very Rico, not very Suave.  2) Highs: Seriously fast, seriously groovy in the turns, serious seats well matched to the serious g capability of the chassis.  Lows: V-6 is a little rough, the clutch takeup is abrupt and stiff besides, tight on toe space in back.  The Verdict: Muscular and poised, and low-profile about it; a machine for you, not your audience.  3) Highs: Hey-lookit-me visuals, plush leather lining, comfy in back (for two), hushed at high speeds.  Lows: The steering&#146;s zone of indifference on-center, flinty ride over small bumps, too many buttons. . The Verdict: All the right stuff but can&#146;t make conversation.  guess the german?"
4479,jimbres,October 2010,"I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. Just my personal preference.  My guess is that you're a young guy. All-season radial tires didn't become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. Before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. Keep in mind that almost everyone drove RWD cars in those days. FWD didn't become widely available until the 70s, & AWD was available only on trucks until the 90s.  I remember that Dad always made the switch to snow tires on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  Something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if you're running with winter tires during the cold weather months. So the total ownership cost is less than you think.  Given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? Think about it. If you can't afford top quality rubber for your car, you might be better off riding the bus."

4486,fedlawman,October 2010,"""You said a few posts back that I said the TSX sales have tanked! Wrong as usual.""  Actually, what he said was:  ""On TSX sales not tanking, i would like to see the numbers.""  I think this was a reasonable request - especially in the context of your original statement containing false information (no manual).  Why don't you simply provide a link to your source that shows how strong TSX sales are and put this matter to rest?  BTW - I think this discussion is a good one, but the personal jabs between the two of you are a problem. We are talking about cars here - there's no need to get inflamed."
4487,sweendogy,October 2010,"i agree lawman.. but smarty is again mistaken as you posted, just like he was mistaken about me even talking about the TSX -- i have never made comments saying the tsx sales have tanked but I did say and prove (using hondas own sales numbers) that TL sales have ""tanked"" since they changed to the modern design -- i can pull up the numbers again for the TL --the car i mentioned. Smarty might be having flashbacks on the TL2009+ chat when i threw a bunch of slaes facts about the TL.  But for smarty to say the TSX sales not tanking-well again I would like to see the numbers -- wait i went to wiki and here are the facts- Total American sales 2003[28] 18,932 2004 30,365 2005[29] 34,856 2006 38,035 2007[30] 33,037 2008[30] 31,998 2009 28,650  2009 was when they changed the body style-- I dont think this is a tank job-ALA TL -- so smarty I agree..but acura in general cant be happy with the present momentum of sales. that was easy (sorry for the long post)"
4488,smarty666,October 2010,"Again, you put words in their that I did not say. I did not say that TSX sales were strong or really really good. All I said was that TSX sales have not tanked and they haven't!  Here is some even better figures then sweens about the TSX: Directly from Acura media released on Oct 1st based on Sept and 2010 sales.  Sept 2010 2,256  Sept 2009 2,103  Percent Change +7.3%  YTD Sept 2010 22,843  YTD Sept 2009 21,300  Percent Change +7.7%"
4489,smarty666,October 2010,"Seriously, what is wrong with you? For the last time, I DID NOT say TSX sales tanked, I said TSX sales HAD NOT TANKED! :mad:  Just because they have decreased over the last two years by a few thousand does not mean they are tanking and as I just showed you in a post above, the TSX is higher in sales this year thus far then at this time last year hence a upward rise.  Yeah, your figures really showed how bad the TSX sales have tanked :blush:  And here is the figures for the TL to show its decrease in sales and thus poor sales performance, taken from Acura media newsroom.  YTD 2010 25,031  YTD 2009 25,882  YTD - 1.8%  TL 2004 Sales: 77,895 TL 2005 Sales: 78,218 TL 2006 Sales: 72,348 TL 2007 Sales: 58,545 TL 2008 Sales: 48,766 TL 2009 Sales: 33,620  As you can see, the sales decrease in the TL is quite substantial compared to the TSX and hence why I have said tanked for the TL. It is sad considering the TL was Acura's bread and butter model for so many years and that now has changed to the MDX. You can state a whole host of reasons why it dropped but its safe to say that the TSX has been a better success for them then the TL is right now."

4492,tlong,October 2010,"Isn't the entire auto market up over 20% '09 vs. '10? If so, a 7.7% rise means the TSX is not holding its own.  FWIW, IMHO the new TSX is another example of how Honda is going all wrong lately -- bigger, softer, and more tarted up with gadgets. But not better."

4501,edwardsf,November 2010,"Re: the acceleration, I think it is called salesman ignorance, not BS  Regarding the turbolag in the A4, I think it is not the AWD but is the lousy CVT Audi puts in the FWD A4. The CVT improves gas mileage but acceleration suffers. (I liked the CVT in the Maxima.) I test drove several 2010 A4s with and without the CVT and there is a huge difference between the CVT and the tiptronic in the Quattro - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster. I had a 2007 Quattro A4, which had a little more turbo lag - the 2010 is much smoother and almost eliminates turbo lag. That said, turbo lag ain't all bad because it means you get turbo acceleration. As fun and fast as my 328iT is, it does not give the whoosh that the torque in the A4 gives in 40-60 mph.  I am an odd creature in that I love Audis (and Swedish Saabs) but don't own one. I own a bimmer because it is quieter and I have a hearing problem. Both are vunderval! cars. The A4 is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a smoother, more refined driving feel. The 328 handles better, is faster throughout the mph range and is more reliable. The 335, of course, is faster but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. Regarding size, the 328i (sedan) is a bit cramped but the iT (sportwagon) has about the same amount of interior space as the A4 sedan and wagon.  Or, how about a used 528 or 535? If you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of CPO. You eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well. Cars.com has a 2009 in L.A. with 13k for $36,000. You could get it for $31,000.  Other thoughts - try the new Volvo S60. It looks very cool and is very fast. New Jags are gorgeous.  Dap, You are right: The G37 IS cramped. The C300 IS cramped. The IS250 IS like a 70s band - supercramped. The TL DOES have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. The TSX IS downscale from these cars but still a cool rig. The CTS - despite what Pletko thinks - IS an American car."
4502,plekto,November 2010,"Yes, but it's unlike anything GM has produced to date. It punks almost everything from Japan and most of the stuff out of Europe and was designed with European tastes and drivers in mind.  But yeah, it is made by a U.S. based company."
4503,dap2006,November 2010,"I test drove several 2010 A4s with and without the CVT and there is a huge difference between the CVT and the tiptronic in the Quattro - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster.  Ahh, that explains it - I'll be going back to try the Quattro soon. I really liked the Audi interior - truly a pleasure. My wife seems to think we need a bigger back seat but that is a minor consideration for me - it would get little use.  I'll really have to give the CPO 535 some thought - I really hadn't considered buying a used car but I can see it has its advantages.  The CTS isn't a player for me, though I'm sure it's a nice car."
4504,sanjaysdca,November 2010,If you are looking at slightly used check out Infiniti M. Nice cars with big depriciation.  Autotrader has one 2009 M35 AWD with 15K miles for $39K 2008 M35 with 31K miles for $32K  Both in orange county (ZIP 62626)
4505,plekto,November 2010,"Kind of odd, though, that you won't consider a pre-owned CTS while you will consider a pre-owned 535. They are fairly similar. But the CTS is a lot less expensive as a CPO vehicle and quite a bit more reliable as well.  Another car to try out - and this is a bit of an oddball, but bear with me - is the RX8. It fits 4 adults just fine, and the oddly shaped rear doors aside, it's basically a 4 door sport sedan. Fantastic ride, though - just a tiny bit slower than a Boxster and handles as well, too.  The last would be either a Saab or Volvo.  Other than that, well, you're stuck with crossovers and SUVs. It honestly sounds like your wife wants a RAV4 or similar and you want a 3 series and you're stuck in a no-man's land of trying to find the perfect compromise. Except that compromises by nature aren't perfect and never will be.  P.S. If you want Audi at less money, just get the VW version. But expect to pay a lot in repairs and upkeep for both. I've never known anyone who has had either brand who hasn't had it chew at their pocketbook to keep running."

Another clever joke by you: the VW CC is the VW version of the Audi A4. No. It's not. Not anymore than a Chevy Malibu is a CTS. Different platform. Different engine configuration and tuning.

I couldn't do another G sedan even with the upgrades from 08' to 11' the car is...well...'nice'.  The used 09' 5 series is an interesting option...hmmm."
4508,plekto,November 2010,"I was a little sarcastic, but I guess it got lost in translation. He's pretty much unhappy with everything, and really he's got maybe Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Volvo left. He wants something sporty and that handles well, and we're out of options, really. (I personally think his wife needs to get over the whole cargo/back seat thing unless they have 3 kids) It sounds like she wants a crossover/wagon.  Oh, wait - I forgot one - the Lexus G. That's about all that's left.  As for the VW/Audi comparison, it depends which models. He obviously thinks that the A4 is too small, so the next size larger, well there IS a VW that uses the A3 platform but is between the A4 and A6 in size (ie - the Passat) While they aren't literal clones, they share so much DNA and parts they might as well be fighting over who gets the china in the estate sale.  I'd certainly not pay Audi prices without looking at the Passat first."

Your sarcasm seems to flow from frustration with my not considering your GM options, but as I originally posted, I'm not a fan of the American offerings - nothing personal there.  Likewise, I don't consider VW, Mazda, or Mitsubishi as acceptable alternatives. And while my wife prefers a larger back seat than an A4, I don't think that confines us to Rav 4's or SUV-type options.  To get back to the discussion, at this point my best bets seem to be a G37, M37, BMW 5 series (new or more likely CPO) - still thinking (and thanks to all!)"
4510,Kirstie_H,November 2010,"I'll throw in my $0.02 here, realizing that that's all it is...  You're likely to get much more bang for your buck by going used on any of the 3 vehicles at the top of your list. I'd look for off-lease / CPO vehicles. In my experience, leased vehicles are often more well-looked after if for no other reason than the person leasing fears extra charges at lease turn-in. I bought a G35 several years ago off-lease and it had taken a pretty significant depreciation hit.... I've beat the tar out of it mileage-wise and mechanically it's still perfect. YMMV."
4511,dap2006,November 2010,"I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive."
4512,Kirstie_H,November 2010,"You seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and that's great. I'm sure you'll end up with what's right for you. The only aspect of leasing vs. buying CPO for *me* is that I can get a used G-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, I own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. Something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest!"
4513,plekto,November 2010,"I could have sworn that I also pointed that out before as well. :P Why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? Everyone that I know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because there's no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. And the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.  The cars you are looking at are fine, really - I happen to like the CTS. But that's literally the ONLY GM or Ford car that I can stand - I'm certainly no fan and would buy a Mercedes or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. I've owned a (used) S Class in the past and the Domestics have a LONG way to reach that level. For the first three months I'd constantly be amazed just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous Buick and the Mercedes. It died - sad story there. Then I got a 4x4  Two other cars to look at would be the E class and the Lexus GS350. These depreciate quickly and are two excellent ""hidden gems"" in the CPO world. A 2007 GS 350 should run you about 25K and a 2009 E class (built on the new more reliable C class platform, but stretched) should be about 30K.  Optimally, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the E class came out in 2009. The 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.  IIRC, Mercedes also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on CPO models from time to time.(yes, lease a CPO used car - C class payments on a E class) Lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - You'd have to check for specifics.  edit - they DO have 1.9% for 48 months on CPO C class models right now - it's going to be hard to beat that price-wise. The new/better body style started in 2008. IMO, the rear seats in the new C class are roomier than in the G37. The panoramic sunroof is incredible as well."
4514,Kirstie_H,November 2010,"well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. I can understand why that would be attractive. And, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, there's another reason.  I wouldn't lease, but I can understand why some people do."
4515,igozoomzoom,November 2010,"""I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive.""  BMW Financial Services and Infiniti Financial Services both offer leases on CPO vehicles, just like new ones. BMW limits the lease term to no more than 48 months on vehicles that aren't current model year, but that's the only major difference that I am aware of. The lease payments should also be quite a bit lower than new without the hit of first year depreciation!  BMW CPO warranty extends the New Car Full Vehicle 4-year/50k warranty to 6-years/100k miles. Infiniti also extends the warranty to 6yrs/100k.  If you decide to check out Infiniti CPO offerings, I still find the previous-generation (2006-2010) M35/M45 very appealing....especially the M35 Sport model! =)"
4516,edwardsf,November 2010,"I just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a CPO. Kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly. Also, I never felt it was my car ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ).  But leasing a CPO is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change  BTW, I think the BMW CPO is not quite as good as you have it described. When the new car warranty ends the CPO begins. It is consecutive, not cumulative. So, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a CPO car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. So you only get 2 years or 40k miles of CPO - whatever is less.  I think you pay $50 when you take it in for CPO repairs. Also, the CPO also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. Still, for $22,000 off the MRSP of a car with no model changes, I will take it."
4517,r34,November 2010,"There is no deductible for the CPO program of Saab (the dealers were more generous to define an issue as warranty work too) but there is a $50 deductible (per service visit) for Audi, BMW, and Infiniti.  Several of my friends got G35 and FX34/45 with no extended warranty or CPO, they seem to be doing fine.  CPO is a way to go for European cars. The repair could be expensive. I had 3 Saabs. They had good engines but got minor issues. The 9-5 Aero was the best and I still missed it. I wanted to try something different.  I tried the G35x but was not impressed. I was looking at Infiniti EX/FX and BMW 530xi but ended up with a 335xi (love the twin turbo and I didn't need backseats).  I traded one Saab for a V6 A4 and another Saab for a 335xi (I need AWD for my daily commute to Milwaukee from Chicago).Except the 1st Saab, I bought them all as used (CPO).  No big issues with them. The A4 seems to be better. VW is still unreliable but Audi seems to be ok now (mine has zero problem). I test drove the Passat. Audi and VW are different!  I like the interior and the image of of Audi (good for road trip) but I like the power and handling of the Bimmer. If the new S4 is really as good as the 335i, I will definitely get the S4.  If backseats is a MUST, I would pick 535i."
4518,kyfdx,November 2010,"..while technically possible, isn't practical in most cases... Usually, the brand-new model will lease out at a lower price..  New BMW leases include free maintenance... You can really lock in your costs... Tires, gas, insurance... that's it for three years..  If you think that isn't valuable, call your local Infiniti or Lexus dealer and tell the you are bringing in your G or IS for the 30K service and ask for a quote... :surprise:"
4519,smarty666,November 2010,"Yeah, but add up the extra amount per month on the lease and what you had to put down on that BMW, similarly equipped of course, to that G or IS and see if it adds up to a lot more, at the end of the 3 or 4 year lease, to what is going to be quoted by the Infiniti or Lexus dealer for the 30K service  Your indirectly paying for that ""FREE"" maintenance by the Bimmer's higher price premium and lease."

4521,Kirstie_H,December 2010,"My bad - it's 9. The other two aren't vehicles, but other categories. I can only have 9 vehicles, and I can't just choose ""IS"" under Lexus - I can only be specific.  I did update Infiniti to be G37 rather than G35."

I'll bet they gave the person a fantastic deal on their new Acura and gave $18K on the trade stating ""well, a RWD car with a stick is a hard sell around here in central Jersey."" Then they turned around and wrote ""Hard to find"" in the ad. Probably could walk out of that dealership paying maybe $20,500 - $21,000 + TTL."
4523,qbrozen,December 2010,"With Nav, too. Nice find.  Trade-in is right near $21k, however, so you'd be looking at more like $23k-$24k to buy it."

4529,nyccarguy,December 2010,"Much as it did that winter night/morning in Buffalo during the late fall of 1996. I was at a cliub with some friends in Buffalo (I went to college about 2 1/2 hours away in Ithaca). My friend who I was visiting (and at the club with) was in a shall we say intoxicated state and getting very friendly with a 6' tall blonde. At about 3:30 AM I decided I had had enough and wanted to go back to his place to crash.  ""Chris, give me your keys. I'll meet you back at your place later. Call me if you need a lift.""  With the flick of his wrist, he tossed me the keys to his 1995 E36 BMW 325is. Red/Black leather. 5 speed manual transmission. HK, Sunroof, & most importantly Sport Package + additional factory lowering.  Now up until this point, I was a novice at driving stick and had never had any real seat time in a BMW. I thought they were for ""show offs."" My entire point of view changed by the time I took off from the 1st traffic light. I had never driven a car that I just felt so perfect in. I drove the car around the streets of Buffalo for the next 2 1/2 hours. By the end of the night, I was steering around right turns with the throttle & rotating around corners perfectly. I've wanted a BMW ever since.  Fast forward to December 2, 2010. The numbers don't mean a whole helluva lot. BMW gets good money for their cars and they are worth every penny.  I've got my Mom's '08 E90 BMW 328xiA (almost 61,000 miles) until Saturday. Even saddled with all wheel drive & automatic transmission, it is still a true driver's car. You all know how much I love my '01 Prelude Type SH (almost 132,000 miles). My Mom's BMW is one of the few cars I've driven that almost make my Prelude feel ""loose.""  The drive from my parents house in Rockland County, NY to my house in Stamford, CT changed my mind and reinvigorated my passion for BMWs. I'd take a 328i with its 230 horsepower, no NAV, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick. It is just an amazing car to drive. I would even consider a CPO or private party used (as long as the person has service records & the car passes a PPI) and I've only owned new cars my entire driving life since I got my license."
4530,qbrozen,December 2010,"I'd take a 328i with its 230 horsepower, no NAV, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick.  That's exactly what I'd want, too. Sport and stick. Nothing else needed. Well.... OK, I'd want the USB port, too."
4531,fedlawman,December 2010,"Thanks for a great story NYC! Very nice memories.  For me, when I was in the Army, I was passing through Dallas to spend a few days with my uncle (yes, the one with a thing for Acuras). Back in the 80's and 90's, he was strictly a BMW guy (320i, 325e, then 325i).  We went on a liquor run to OK and he let me drive his then new E30. Up until that point, all I had owned/driven was my dad's Accord, and my Alfa Romeo Spider and CRX Si.  I had a similar epiphany - how could such a simple car (my uncle is minimalist - his E30 had NO options) be so much better than anything I had ever driven. Of course, I didn't have the scratch to buy a BMW so I owned many more imitators before I finally got the real thing.  They really are that good. Sublime."

Funny, for me the situation was in 1998. I was looking for a premium smaller sedan. I drove a brand new (was that the E36?) 1999 BMW 323, but the dealer only had an automatic. It seemed decent but I wasn't wowed. Then I drove a 1998 Audi A4, 6 cyl, manual. There was no comparison. The Audi had a much nicer interior, the clutch and stick were like butter, and the steering and suspension were taut and precise. I bought it."
4533,alltorque,December 2010,"That Volvo S60 looks nice on paper, but I think in one review I read that it is more of an A4/Lexus Competitor than G37/3 Series.  Have driven the new S60 here in UK, (admittedly only the D3 and D5 Geartronics), at a Volvo track day I can say that it is at least a match for any 3-series up to/incl the 330D. One of the pro-drivers rated them equal in the dry but gave the S60 the edge in the wet. New S60 really is a vastly different car to the outgoing model and made my '06 S60 D5 Geartronic seem positively wooden by comparison. Mag reviews are fine for rough comparison...............you need to drive 'em to really find out. Before I drove the S60 I was thinking; ""Hmm so it's a re-skin"". After 4 hours of all kinds of silliness I was smitten. It's a new car from the wheels up."
4534,nyccarguy,December 2010,"If I were to order one, it would have a 6-speed stick, Sport Pkg, Heated Seats, iPod/USB, Sirius, Xenon, Leatherette, Sunroof, & Metallic Paint."
4535,qbrozen,December 2010,"What annoys me about their sales pitch on the new S60, though, is calling it the ""sportiest volvo ever.""  Here in the US, at least, the T6 only comes with an automatic. The S60R had the same peak engine outputs, was a lighter car, and was available with a stick. Gotta tip yer hat to that as being more sporty, if not even the sportiest."
4536,qbrozen,December 2010,"ordering? yeah, I'd probably add bun warmers, Sirius, and Xenons, as well. Moonroof is not on my list. I'd rather do without to save weight. And, for some reason, I hate paying for paint."
4537,roadburner,December 2010,"At the age of 14 I coerced my dad into test driving a 1972 Bavaria. The salesman drove it first and demonstrated how well it cruised at 120 mph. I was hooked, but I didn't end up with my own BMW until 1983 when I bought a 1973 Bavaria- which my girlfriend at the time(and now my wife of almost 25 years) had found for me. She had wisely determined that the way to my heart led through the garage..."
4538,nyccarguy,December 2010,"I don't like the idea of paying for paint either. Does it really cost an extra $550 to paint a car a different color. The E90 looks terrific in so many colors. The Vermillion Red looks amazing.  I know sunroofs add weight, but I like 'em.  Funny thing about paying for paint. My Mom's lease is up on her 328xi at the end of this month. She ordered a Porsche Cayenne V6. Called me up after she visited the dealer & gushed about the truck. After she told me what options she specd out, I asked her what color. She told me White. This took me by surprise as she's never come close to wanting a white car. Now the white happens to be a fantastic color for the Cayenne. I said: White? She told me she refuses to pay $800 for a specific color & she really loves the white."
4539,nyccarguy,December 2010,"I had a college friend who had a 1984 E30 BMW 325e with a 5 speed stick. The car was 10 years old and had well over 100K miles on the odometer. The speedometer didn't work. One day we're cruising the back roads of Ithaca, NY & I asked him how he knew how fast he was going. He tells me it clicks on every once in a while. We went over a bump in the road, the car got some air & when it landed, the speedo clicked on & read 105 mph. The car was amazingly solid & stable at that speed.  BMWs are special cars no doubt."
4540,Kirstie_H,January 2011,"Most excellent advice. No one's criticizing your children, your profession, your intellect - they're expressing a different opinion about whether your car is a class leader. Even if you post ONE more time that it sells well, the opinion will continue to differ. I've been around for ages as well, and I have yet to see anyone berated and argued into submitting to another member's opinion - I've seen them respond to fact, but opinion? No.  The Hyundai Sonata is selling extremely well. Does that make it an ELLPS? No. That fact in no way detracts from the vehicles sales or appeal, but sales numbers do not indicate anything about the car apart from its appeal to consumers. Period.  Let's avoid turning this discussion, and a very minor point within that discussion, into the Middle East conflict."
4541,fedlawman,January 2011,I personally think the Maxima is a nice car. It just isn't an ELLPS and doesn't warrant so much real estate in this forum.  Maybe you should create a new thread: Maxima vs. LaCrosse vs. Taurus vs. Genesis.
4542,Kirstie_H,January 2011,"The good news is that such a thread already exists: Mainstream Large Sedans  It's not been active in awhile, but perhaps, as with many general discussions, it would see new life & activity with an on-topic post to stimulate conversation."
4543,saratoga3,January 2011,"thanks smarty666 for your replies to my Maxima question, you have been very helpful. I feel responsible for this thread turning heated! my only intention was to get some feedback from members here who have shopped for the Max VS the Infiniti, the same as I have been doing."
4544,smarty666,January 2011,"That was what I was trying to do in the first place, give you information to try and help make a decision. It basically comes down to this, both vehicles serve two different purposes, one is not vastly superior to the other, it all depends on what your personal situation is and what one fits your needs and driving style better. That is what I made the decision on when I was choosing between the two."
4545,savetheland,January 2011,"I never saw new Maxima in person. Nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. Last one in San Jose for some reason had Infinitis on display, but not Nissans. I saw Maxima on the road though and it has presence while G looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. Anyway Infinity G is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has RWD after all. So it is not efficient as a family car.  Well what I actually wanted to say that I went to Nissan website and took a look. Agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. The point I want to make is that I compared it with closest competitors - Buick Regal and Lincoln MKZ - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. It does not look like competitor to Avalon or Taurus which are larger cars.  Then I went to truecar.com and configured Maxima with all options and got price around $33,600 in Bay area - almost 6K discount from sticker price. Similarly equipped entry level luxury cars, like A4, MKZ, G37 cost around 36K-37K according to truecar.com. Regal is priced similar to Maxima with 2.0T turbo engine. BTW A4 has engine similar to Buick and MKZ as engine similar to Maxima, but better interior quality. And I guess Buick is to A4 (both are German cars) same as Maxima to G. With exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than Maxima. I would certainly test drive and compare Regal to Maxima, Regal may prove to be more sporty car after all (though Opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. If you do not like G - CTS is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0L engine. True there is G25 Journey - but it is decontented car, it costs less. BMW is even smaller car than G and Lexus IS is smaller yet.  I remember comparos where Maxima lost to Dodge Charger in its spoting intentions. Nissan after all is a large FWD car. I drove previous Maxima - it was smaller but no more sporty than base Mustang. I do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about Maxima. People use sport-sedan notion too often. I heard even Sonata called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous."
4546,plekto,January 2011,"It is worth noting as well that the CTS is almost as good as a BMW 5 series in hard driving.(that said, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car) That base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary. The interior as well is almost identical to an Acura or Audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is. It feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the G37 does that as well, I have to admit). The panoramic sunroof is awesome. And in a first for GM, the NAV system actually works.  My only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the Civic, there are *zero* visual cues). But it's not alone in that, either. The worst offender currently is actually the new Honda Crosstour, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. It also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a Cadillac to have a hood ornament. It's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.  Me, I don't parallel park if I can help it, so it's not an issue. Just something to be aware of.  edit - truecar and cars direct say there are still some 2010 CTS models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32K if you don't mind black. (27.5K for a base model(29 with auto), 30K for the Luxury, 32K for the Performance, and 34K for the 3.6) Almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.  But.. even a base model CTS for ~29K... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20K range drop off of my radar. Especially the emasculated Regal. Got to love year end fire sales at GM."

4551,plekto,January 2011,The base model with manual is 3208lbs. A little weight trimming and a few aftermarket mods and you're looking at probably 3100lbs without too much expense.
4552,roadburner,January 2011,"It's definitely piqued my interest.  I came very close to ordering a a 2011 128i, optioned to my specs(M Sport Pkg, Cold Weather Pkg, Harman-Kardon audio, keyless entry, and xenons). Manual leather seats and no hole in the roof. My dealer was offering $2000 off MSRP. With BMW's $1500 Holiday cash and my $500 CCA rebate I was looking at @$32000+TTL. Good deal, but I kept thinking what I could buy used for similar money, such as a Z4 M Coupe or a Cayman. I'd have the same dilemma with the 1er M Coupe- for $47,000 I can get a CPO E9x M3 or better yet, a pristine 2005 0r 2006 E46 M3 ZCP(and have plenty of cash left over for a Brembo kit, pads, and track tires)."

The 25x is about 4k cheaper and if you can do without the xtra HP of the 37x it might be a good way to get into the car new, if you can do without some of the 37's options not available on the 25.You also gain about 2 xtra miles per gallon on the 25.

4562,cdnpinhead,January 2011,"if one wants a manual transmission, it's time to go to work. They're rarely stocked, and when they are, they're liable to be loaded with s*** (let's say stuff) that I don't want. When I got mine, I checked inventories all over the West and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from Denver that I couldn't see. Once that happens, serious bargaining goes out the window.  Either way, I have my manual, and I enjoy it.  Point being, if none are available for test drives, most people will give up. The same thing happens with BMW, among others.  Chicken & egg."
4563,fedlawman,January 2011,"My experience back in 04 was just the opposite.  I wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldn't find anything that wasn't fully loaded.  Then, having read the favorable magazine reviews, I test drove the TSX 6MT and that was it - I never looked back. It was so tossable and playful, and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine I had ever experienced - nicer even than the also excellent BMW.  Ironically, I was totally satisfied with it until I took it to a couple of BMW club track days (where, BTW, I was able to keep pace with E46 330is and E36 M3's) and decided that I wanted RWD.  Except for it being FWD, the TSX has almost the perfect mix of sportiness, luxury, and refinement. It was simply a pleasure to own - and for 90% of drivers (who don't take their cars to lapping days), FWD is no handicap."
4564,nyccarguy,January 2011,"Coupes don't sell - That's why Honda KILLED OFF cars like the CL, RSX, & My Beloved Prelude. Another 50 Horsepower (The V6 TSX gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. The 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to Acura's FWD platform. The numbers don't tell the whole story."

The 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to Acura's FWD platform.  Maybe you think 250 HP is too much to drive the front wheels, but I beg to differ.  I've got 272 HP going to the front wheels of my Mazda6, and it's just right. I've suffered NO torque steer, even when exiting a tight corner. The only tug I've felt with a FWD V6 is with an Altima 3.5SE I tested a few years ago.  I've even driven the TSX V6, and felt that the power was nice, with no noticeable torque steer. Can't say that for the 4-cylinder, even with a manual. The power was adequate, but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the G and 3-series, and I wasn't about to drop $36K on a FWD sedan just for the V6 (which IMO is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine)."
4566,smarty666,January 2011,"The 6-spd is slowly being introduced right now. The ZDX and MDX have it and in a few months, the TL will have it with the 2012 update. I suspect that the TSX will get it in the next year or two."
4567,sweendogy,January 2011,"honda didnt kill off the accord and civic coupe....during that time nissan introduced the g35 coupe and now an altima coupe, lexus has the is250C, bmw continues to make a 3, and 6, audi the a5, mbusa yep they have a few as well.. if they sold a tsx-like coupe it would outsell the ZDX and RL combined.. i understand the TSX is a great FWD car, and numbers dont tell the whole story, but the point is they need to step it up a bit."
4568,flightnurse,March 2011,"For a Audi Forum I love how the TSX has taken over.  I never understood why Acrua thought they needed a V6 in the TSX, never made sense. If they wanted more HP, then take the turbo engine from the RDX and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 HP range. This would give the TSX more HP without having some of the FWD turbo issues. Add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.  Being back in school for my masters, I needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so I went with a 2010 Ford Fusion SE with 6 spd manual and the Appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. I got 235/40/HR18 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24K OTD. It has a bigger back seat then the TSX and living here in Phoenix, the last thing I want in the summer time is leather.  But I'll be looking for a new 2012 A4 once I'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the TSX, BMW or C class."

4572,rayainsw,June 2011,I have driven numerous G35s and 1 G37. I have a 335iS on order - for European Delivery in September. Good luck w/your quest! - Ray One data point......
4573,carnaught,June 2011,"Although the G37 is more engaging to drive than the ES350, you'll tire quickly of the intrusiveness (loud growl of the engine, etc.) of the Infiniti. Unless you're planning a lease, the relatively poor resale of the Infiniti is also a negative.  Personally, I'd go for the BMW. Also, for $h*ts and giggles, drive the VW CC; you might be pleasantly surprised."
4574,billyperks2,June 2011,"Co-worker took me on a two mile trip in the CC, I couldn't wait to get out-BLAH. Another Co-worker took me to lunch in his Audi 4 2.0 T, I felt like I was on a NYC subway during rush hour- car was cramped, its worst than my 99 Millennia."
4575,littlejoe613,June 2011,"You may have to do some more up-to-date research before commenting.......the resonant tailpipe tone on my G37 Coupe is intentional. The resale for my leased G37 is 56 percent which I understand is great for this segment. G37 has more features, is more reliable plus alot less costly to own than Lexus or BMW's. VW CC ? , Come on it isnt even close to an Infiniti in quality. The ES350 is a car for grandpa. The IS350 is actual a better competitor to the 335i, Acura TL and the G37 than the ES 350. I laugh everytime one of my buddies takes his BMW in for repairs or maintenance after 50k...Its a joke. Don't take my word for it competitive info is all over the internet and this site."
4576,fedlawman,June 2011,"The ""growl"" of the engine in the G37 is different than the resonance from the tailpipe. It's the VQ's unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think it's going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 RPM.  BMW's inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding, smoothest revving engines on the planet, and it's well worth the premium in price to have it."
4577,nyccarguy,June 2011,You know you are getting the BMW kdshapiro! An ES350?
4578,sweendogy,June 2011,"unrefined i laugh at that- the engine has been a work horse for nissan for years-has won engine of the year multiple times over (in prev variations) - it throws out 330 hp and gets ok fuel economy. Its not a bmw engine no, but its not unrefined -- drive a base dodge charger and you'll worry about ""throw a rod"" as you try to get on a local on ramp. Infiniti might be louder then BMW but again its different - i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle- we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points, the power, the sporty nature and quality.  i own a infiniti g35x from 2007, actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form."
4579,kdshapiro,June 2011,"Ya' know, I've been a member of edmunds since 1999. In the 12 years since I have joined a lot has changed in my life.  At this point, I am looking for a comfortable cruiser with decent gas mileage.  In my quest I decided to lowball the dealers because I am ready to take delivery with the right price. if I can't get the deal I want for the specific car, I'll move on to the next manufacturer/dealer.  As far as the IS250 it is way to small for me at this point in time."
4580,plekto,June 2011,"Well, if you don't put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. And the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.  http://editorial.autos.msn.com/listarticle.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211 They say that less than 3% of U.S. tire sales are for winter tires. They tested a G37 with and without and the findings are surprising if you aren't familiar with these types of tires.  Quote (MSN Autos): What About All-Wheel Drive? Often cited as the transportation cure for winter climates, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. In previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter rubber, but that's where the advantage ends. The additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. Of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. That's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winter  Here's a video of all season vs winter tires: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4s  So you should forget AWD and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. If you live where you really get bad snow, that is."
4581,gooddeal2,June 2011,"Yeb, I hardly find just a RWD here unless I want a MT. 99.9% of the Gs are AWD in Philly."
4582,kdshapiro,June 2011,I have plenty of snow experience. The awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.  I don't want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. But in the northeast there are a lot of cars on the road with awd.  It easy to sit in LA and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. Why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains?
4583,Kirstie_H,June 2011,"Heck, even going to Kansas City would do. Two winters with 40+ inches of snow each year switched me to 4WD in a heartbeat. No regrets.  While it's all well and fine for people to keep giving ideas about how to turn a RWD sport sedan into a decent snow performer with better tires, etc., I can tell you that my 4WD vehicle outperforms my G35 in the snow, period."
4584,plekto,June 2011,"Yet, you don't hear about people in Europe having problems with RWD Mercedes and BMWs being dangerous in the winter, do you? Winter tires are considered a normal thing in Germany and everyone uses them.  It's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. The way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an AWD system.  Proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. That video, btw, that I linked to was of a RWD BMW.  Oh, and we do get snow in California. I didn't always live in So. Cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. And in all of that time, I never once considered what type of drive (FWD/RWD/4WD) the vehicle had when I purchased it. I adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation."
4585,Kirstie_H,June 2011,"I didn't pay thousands extra for my AWD vehicle, and I didn't see anyone allude that your RWD will fly instantly off the road. Just that AWD performs better.  Ever live in Europe? I'm guessing not. I have. It's a bit silly to lump all of Europe into a single category, because some areas get almost no snow, but anyway... not everyone in Germany drives a RWD vehicle, and I'm not sure it would make international news if some of those who did had trouble in the snow. I will say that much of England pretty much shuts down if there's 2"" of snow - could we attribute that to the prevalence of RWD vehicles in Europe? I doubt it, but that debate point makes as much sense as your point about ""not hearing about BMWs/Mercedes flying off the road in Germany.""  As I said, talk all you want. We've had two RWD vehicles at the same time in winter, and 2 AWD vehicles at that same time. I'm going to choose the AWD vehicle in heavy snow 100% of the time, even if you tell me yet another time how RWD is a non-issue if you have proper tires and driving skills."
4586,plekto,June 2011,"Well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with AWD.  Does it actually work? Most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. If the system transfers power back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly. Most manufacturers get this horribly wrong.  The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distribution. (0/100 under default conditions). It's basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from videos of the system in action that I have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's AI to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)  Too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. There are numerous articles and videos out there about half-baked AWD systems, so I'll not go into this further.  The other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. Is it worth it? Probably not. It's certainly not full-time AWD like Audi and Subaru use."
4587,kdshapiro,June 2011,"The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distribution  It may perform the same but I'll bet it doesn't react the same. What I want out of my AWD system is not to have to worry about powering through deep drifts. I want to be able to step on the gas gently and have all four tires partipate in gingerly moving the car without throwing it into a skid.  With RWD with snows, gingerly is not in the equation. It doesn't matter whose system is better, I want the system to be just good enough so I won't get stuck.  The ATTESA has been written up for the last several years as the best performance AWD.  Come this winter I will find out."
4588,tlong,June 2011,"Don't forget that AWD doesn't do anything for braking. It can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all cars brake on all four wheels."
4589,m6user,June 2011,I'll be sure to tell the tow truck driver pulling me out of a snow drift that he really doesn't need 4WD on his truck.....just get some snow tires.
4590,tlong,June 2011,Don't see how your comment is relevant to my comment. :surprise:
4591,plekto,June 2011,"Yeah.. as I've said numerous times before if you are THAT concerned with snow, just get 4x4 as it actually does work like it should. I can guarantee that my friend's 4Runner will outperform almost any AWD system on almost any surface.  But of course, it's big, expensive, and eats lots of gas and all of that... And you can't use the 4x4 mode on pavement. Then again, you really don't NEED to given how well it drives."
4592,ivan_99,June 2011,I vote for a boat-car...imagine the possibilities.  Plus safety...
4593,plekto,June 2011,"Heh.  Of course, I was being a little bit sarcastic there. :P But I think I also have a valid point in that if you are looking for a ""luxury performance sedan"", AWD is a minor concern compared to all of the other factors. Because the fact is that most of them will be RWD or heavily RWD biased anyways. You will need winter tires if you want to drive it during the winter months.  It just makes more sense to spend the extra $1500 on a second set of rims and winter tires and just swap them every 6 months or so."
4594,kdshapiro,June 2011,"None of these cars are being raced at nascar. Even the 750 comes with awd these days.  Meh I would rather go for the awd instead of a second set of rims. Awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.  10 years I probably would have been preaching being a purist. Now I just want to enjoy my ride and I don't care if I'm getting the last ounce of performance from it. Or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. I just don't want to get stuck.  As an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions."
4595,nyccarguy,June 2011,"I'm with you regarding AWD. I've seen all the tests & read all the arguments. I know that a RWD car equipped with snow tires & all of today's electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore brake better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & AWD. 2 of my 3 cars ('01 Prelude & '10 TSX) are FWD and I equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. Do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome traction in the white stuff? Absolutely. Are they perfect? No.  Changing over isn't that simple, nor is it cheap. My Prelude has a dedicated set of 15"" steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. I store them where I work and have the changeover done by a ""Fix-A-Flat"" place up the block. They charge me $30 each time I changeover.  I didn't buy an extra set of wheels for my TSX, just a set of snow tires. I have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. My Acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.  They don't plow particularly well where I live in Stamford, CT (10 miles from the NY State border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. This past winter was particularly bad, but I can see how AWD can and will be useful in the future.  Every BMW & Mercedes-Benz that's not an ///M (besides the X5 M & X6 M) or AMG, 6, Z4, SL, or SLK is All Wheel Drive that I see in NY & CT.  Besides, my mere average driving skills won't let me squeeze the all out performance out of a RWD, SP Equipped BMW anyway."

Thanks!!"
4600,carnaught,August 2011,"My run-flats were still going strong when I traded the car in with 36,000+ mi. on them. Although I would have preferred go-flats instead, I was appreciative of having them when I got a flat and could drive to a Discount Tire to have it repaired. Yes, I know they are not always reparable."
4601,fedlawman,August 2011,"Sorry, it's not that my research was poor, it's that you aren't following my logic. Here, I'll spell it out...  Rejecting a BMW because you don't like the tires is akin to rejecting a Porsche because the windows aren't tinted dark enough.  And while it's true Porsche's don't have run-flats, it's also true that 911's (and Boxsters & Caymans) don't come with a spare tire. Off topic, but I thought you should know that there are 100's of thousands of drivers buying cars in North America without a spare tire (no, not just Porsche's - Chevy does it too)."
4602,nyccarguy,August 2011,"Fedlawman - don't know if ya heard, but the TSX is now my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife who is now pregnant with #3, who will be daughter #1. I bought her a Pilot, I drive the TSX to work 5 days a week & the Prelude 1 day a week.  Lateral? Ya think? 326 hp in my dd would be nice, but I have trouble keeping my two 200 horsepower 4cyl cars under 90;)"
4603,fedlawman,August 2011,"#3! Wow, you've been busy! Cold winter?  Well, of course it's not lateral in terms of HP, but in terms of refinement, balance, and poise, it certainly is (arguably a step down).  Of course, HP was never my first priority anyways - I mean, I do drive a 4-cylinder too...  On the other hand, the TSX and Prelude are kissing cousins. Maybe you're looking for something completely different? I can understand that.  Well, good luck with whatever you decide to do. I've pretty much decided that my next car will be a 911. Just waiting for the right time and car to come along."
4604,kyfdx,August 2011,"Can I have that crappy 4-banger, when you get the 911?"
4605,fedlawman,August 2011,
4606,2233,August 2011,"I understood your logic sir but I guess I consider the qualities of tires way more important than license plates, tinting, or a windshield wiper.  I never had a car with run flats and I don't think I ever will until there are substantial improvements in them.  Some people really like them so that's what is nice about these forums. Everyone can list the pros and cons and one can make their own decision."
4607,plekto,August 2011,"The interesting thing is that these cars are in the same list.  One is a large front wheel drive sofa on wheels that is trying to be a better Buick (and largely succeeding as well, I have to admit)  One is a small luxury sedan that's extremely understated. A sleeper designed for people who really don't want to show off their money.  One is a blinged-out rear wheel drive muscle car. A luxury 370Z to be exact.  They all are great vehicles by themselves, but they also are completely different at heart. Honestly I need more information from the original poster because as it is, there is no real connection between the three besides price. Do you want luxury and refinement? Speed and power? A mix of the two? Do you want manual? What about size and weight?  For example, if you wanted a luxury barge, then you should be looking at the TL, something from Lexus, or possibly a larger Buick or Cadillac. There's nothing wrong with wanting that (my current car is one - I hate small cars in Los Angeles traffic)  If you want smaller and sporty, the G37, the CTS, and the 3 series all come to mind as top choices.  If you want refined luxury, the Mercedes, Audi, and the Lexus IS(or possibly the GS) are top choices."
4608,Kirstie_H,August 2011,"There are discussions about RFTs and non-RFTs all over the place in the forums. This isn't one of them. Let's not get too sidetracked on this conversation. A little bit, when relevant, is fine, but let's keep the focus on the cars that are on-topic here."
4609,wireless,August 2011,"Just ordered a 2012 C-350...  IS - The Toyota driving experience is just really bad for me. Terribly numb, bloaty, wallowey. Haven't driven an IS but the styling, like most Japanese cars is derivative. It yells ""Me too."" I understand it will be sporty but the Toyota roots are there. I've owned two Toyotas. Will not buy a third. TSX - Wow where did Acura take such a wrong turn with styling? Just uncomfortable to look at. Nutty smiley face and weird rear end. What are they thinking? Cringeworthy. Acura never was that great at style. They've completely gone off the deep end. And Honda used be run by the engineers. Too bad. A4 - good car and I could get a huge discount, better than employee's due the company I work for. Wanted to love this car. Thought it would be the one. Even got the discount all lined up. Interior has slipped a bit for Audi. Good car, but not much of an upgrade over the Passat I have. Actually like the Passat more - inside and out. The Audi has a couple of cool features, best styling but driving it just didn't do anything for us. Also I've heard a lot about the repairs especially the turbo, e.g,, ""cripplingly expensive."" BMW - We drove the 330 and just don't get it. Distinctly downscale interior, drove fairly well. Honestly on this one I'll take a mulligan. I will allow that it is probably a great car, it wouldn't get all the accolades otherwise. For now neither my wife nor I get it. Just at a loss on this one. CTS - Looks ok. Interior good. Doesn't get good reviews. Just don't trust this car to be reliable, and stand the test of time in styling. S60 - I would be interested in a Volvo before Ford bought them. Now just like Jag, and the other PAG cars they have Ford parts running through them. Platforms, switchgear, engines. Like Saab and GM. You're buying a lot of Ford at an Volvo price. I like Ford... but at Ford prices. Also heard resale is bad as well as reliability. C-class - we ordered the C-350. Drove this vehicle and within literally seconds I knew it was something different. Easily the best car I've ever driven. In every way, the sounds it makes, the way it feels, the way it takes corners, everything felt perfect. My wife felt the same way. Way better than the Audi or Bimmer. I know it sounds implausible but it the difference is stark. The price is on up there but I'm at a stage in my life where I can swing it. We even drove the E-class but since my wife will be the primary driver, the C is best for her, easy to handle and toss around, more fun to drive, etc. Only concern is the German electronics after 5 or 10 years."
4610,qbrozen,August 2011,"BMW 330: did you drive a used one? Cause the 330 isn't made anymore.  S60: ford parts? I don't know who told you that, but it is not true. The only thing ford/Volvo shared were basic platforms, and even those were not ""ford products"" since they were jointly developed. There are no shared engines at all. Volvo always continued making their cars in Sweden with their own engineering. Under their new Chinese owners, that continues to be the case for now, too."
4611,wireless,August 2011,"The Bimmer was a 328. Still same impressions apply.  As far as the Volvo goes: trim pieces, steering wheel, tires, wheels, seats, some emissions parts, etc. The may not be interchangeable but the same company makes parts for both. And while I agree that much may be substantially different, one cheap turn signal stalk is a real turn off. Resale value is said to be terrible, so used are a great deal."
4612,carnaught,August 2011,Are there any changes to the 2012 C350?
4613,wireless,August 2011,"Yes, quite a few. MB say over 2000 changes. Big changes are the engine 268 hp to 302, direct injection, 10% better gas mileage, the interior was substantially upgraded, one review said it is better than the E class now. Just do a little research and you'll see the reviews. I haven't seen it in person yet. We drove the 2011. The 2011 wasn't bad but they say the '12 is a lot better. Read the Car and Driver review for more info."
4614,plekto,August 2011,"I've been impressed by Mercedes as of late. Usually you had to get the S to get the top end engineering and reliability. And they were and still are incredible cars.  The C class feels like a half-sized S class. And the difference is more stark if you just do something as simple as let a new TSX and a C idle next to each other. One sounds like it is made out of tin cans by comparison. Now, the Honda *is* a great engine, but it lacks that polished sound and feel that you'd get in, say, a Porsche or other high end car. It's exactly like thinking that your American made Fender Stratocaster is a great guitar (which it is) and then getting your hands on a true custom guitar. The goalposts simply moved without you realizing it, and now you're a bit ruined in your expectations.  For the price, especially with year-end rebates, the C is becoming a very good deal.  The other car that impresses me is the CTS. Reliability is excellent as far as I can tell, aside from the yahoos who break their CTS-V models' engines and rear diffs and then blame it on the manufacturer. My father has one and it sounds and drives 2-3 times better than any other GM car that he's ever had or driven.  The IS and TSX and the rest simply feel dated."
4615,carnaught,August 2011,Sounds like a nice car.  Is the body changed for 2012? Was it custom ordered? When do you get it?
4616,wireless,August 2011,"Every piece of plastic was changed on the C-class. :]  I ordered it with what I wanted. Not many options actually. The C-350 is pretty loaded to start with. I added keylessGO and 18"" AMG Rims.  It's supposed to start production in the first ""decade"" (10 days) of October and be delivered in early November."
4617,flightnurse,September 2011,"Not too sure why you drove a 328i and a C350, since they aren't comparable. YOu needed to drive the 335i since it makes the came HP as the C350, but the 335i is much faster, handles and is a better car overall then the C350.  You stated the A4 interior has slipped, how so? Since all mag's have ranked the interior of the A4 has best in class for the last 5 years, the fit and finish is above that of BMW and MB.  I almost got a A4 but the BMW made a much better deal for me, so I bought a 2011 BMW 328i with 6spd manuel value package Le Mans Blue Metalic Chest Nut Brown leather M sport package (it comes with the color) Moon roof Xenon headlights Comfort Access keyless entry paid $39K out the door.  I looked at MB, but the price for a C300 but MG does not offer a sport package (one os standard on the C300 but its only an apparence package) on its entry level C class. Plus the local MB dealer wasn't really dealing, which wasn't a smarl move since the 2012 is a new C class.  I'm very happy with my car, it handles well, its comfortable, and I love the manuel in the car. My next BMW will be a used 335d, I can't justify the price of a new one."
4618,nyccarguy,September 2011,"Awesome that you bought a 328i with a stick & sports Pkg! Enjoy! You had to special order that car, right?"
4619,nyccarguy,September 2011,"There has been some discussion about the value of the scheduled maintenance. While it is built into the price of the car and we all know it isn't free, it is worth something.  My 2010 TSX is 2 years old and has almost 40,000 miles. While I don't have all the paperwork in front of me, here's what I've done from memory:  Synthetic Oil changes at 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, & (almost) 40K @ $70 a piece at the dealership. Tire Rotations at the same intervals @ $30 a piece  I had to have the rear brake pads replaced & the front rotors resurfaced & cut.  I just had the air filter & cabin filter changed @ $149."
4620,rayainsw,September 2011,"""Poor rear visibility; awkward driving position.""  If those are your 2 primary concerns, i would very strongly urge you to try for yourself - as these both can be highly subjective - and will often depend on your size, weight & build. I rented a CTS a few years ago, and did not find big issues with either of these aspects. - Ray YMMV"
4621,flightnurse,September 2011,"Dude not too sure what you been smoking, but you have some info.  First the TSX is a European Accord, not one from Japan.  The IS and Corrolla have NOTHING in common, first the IS is rear wheel drive and has a V6, the Corrolle is FWD.  The First Gen IS is known in Japan as the Altezza. The 2nd Gen is not sold in Japan  The G37 and 370Z are not the same car. They share some of the FM platform but that is about it, the 370Z wheelbase is about a foot shorter then the G37s.  The CTS is a great looking car but is not screwed together very well. The Resale value of the CTS is horrible, about 45% after 3 years. The IS, G37 and the TSX are between 51 to 55% after 3 years, BMW has the highest resale value.  Regarding service, BMW has 4 yr or 50K miles bumper to bumper maintence as service on thier cars.

4624,andres3,September 2011,"The CTS is a great looking car but is not screwed together very well.  That's putting it lightly. Even the Edmunds long term CTS tester became a rattle trap galore with parts falling apart in its first year. I've found that to be typical with domestic vehicles.  It drove OK, I much preferred the Acuras, Infinitis, Audi's, and BMW's."

Brake pads and rotors often require service prior to 4 years. Does BMW typically pay for repairs such as this under this program. Or are their services usually limited to oil changes and/or major repairs?  How difficult is it to obtain what they might consider discretionary repairs such as brakes?"

I also wondered why seat back cargo nets are still offered on some 3 series vehicles and not on others and why there is no electronic compass on the mirror if you have the navigation package, or why the heated steering wheel is deleted if you have the M Sport package.....All this does not make much sense.

4636,plekto,September 2011,"First - Cadillac did sell a BTS in Europe which was 3 series sized and priced, but it sold only a few hundred of them. The CTS is actually their middle model in the lineup if you look at their entire global Cadillac lineup. They just wisely decided to not sell the smaller one in the U.S. It's is more akin the an E or 5 series. Which isn't too surprising, really. It's bigger, it's heavier, and it's not really designed to be a 3 series competitor.  As for reliability, my parents have owned a standard model with the smaller 3.0L engine in it and it's been flawless. Not a single problem at all in the first year that they've owned it.  And even if something does go wrong, it's a lot less than a Mercedes to fix.  Lastly, yes, I know the Japanese companies play around with names and so on, but the comments are all too true. The G37 does share enough DNA with the Z that it's just not possible to hide the fact that it's a modified Nissan Z. And The IS, while it's not *exactly* based upon a Corolla, it's small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it. Kind of how a Buick is well, a Buick, even if they come in different sizes."
4637,mortienne,September 2011,"""And The IS, while it's not *exactly* based upon a Corolla, it's small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it.""  Based on that logic, the Austin A40 my parents had when I was a kid, and the Ferrari Daytona are similar because they share the same designer. And of course, the current range of Bentleys are just glorified VWs."

4641,andres3,September 2011,"because almost every car these days can be had with leather and NAV, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag.  Not all leathers and NAV systems were created equal. You can have grade A leather, grade b, grade C, grade D, grade F.  The way it is put together, installed, and assmebled can vary in quality as well as the material itself.  I thought the Infiniti's I looked at in 2009 were very nice inside."
4642,flightnurse,September 2011,"The TL is a great car to commute in, but if you are looking for a car with soul, the Acrua line (except for the NSX) is a company to avoid.

4644,plekto,September 2011,"And then you test drove the C class or a BMW.  Huge difference. Quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury.  The main reason Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in Japan, they don't really exist. There is Honda. Period. There is Nissan. End of choices. Toyota just recently stsrted selling Lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of Toyota.  Mercedes, they make luxury cars and that's it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line. It's not a standard vehicle that's been tweaked and had a lot of bling added. It's the real deal. BMW is the same. And Audi, though they are a lot like VW in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering. A lot like say, Cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but it's always been its own company/line.  Acura does nothing for me. In fact, Volvo makes better cars these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most people's radar here) Infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but it's also huge and basically like a big Lexus in how it drives. And, lastly, Lexus. Very nice, but still so devoid of soul and personality that it screams ""safe vanilla choice""."
4645,fedlawman,September 2011,"""That said, the TSX simply doesn't belong as it's just a plain vanilla ""Accord"" to the rest of the world. Over here, they slap Acura badges on it and raise the price. It's front wheel drive, has a plain vanilla 4 cylinder engine, and the handling is, well, standard family car. It's a NICE car, but it's not proper luxury OR proper sports.""  The American Accord is creamy vanilla. The Accord of the ""rest of the world"" (our TSX) is far from it. Your comments make it obvious that you have never actually driven a TSX 6MT at speed.  Around town during a test drive, yes, it might resemble a smaller tighter Accord at first glance, but on a racetrack, there is no comparison. Take it from someone who knows first hand, the TSX is a responsive, dynamic, fun-to-drive sport sedan. Period."
4646,smarty666,September 2011,"You do realize that vehicles from the 5-Series below and E-Class below are not even considered luxury over in Europe? I suppose not. Hate to break it to you, Caddy has never been it own company/line. It has and always will be a luxury division/line of a larger company, just like Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, and Audi are. I do agree with your comments about Lexus though being a ""safe vanilla choice"". Mercedes Benz is another ""safe vanilla choice"" and neither Lexus nor MB has ever done anything to knock my socks off. They both are devoid of soul and fun.  But Infiniti is no way a safe vanilla choice by any stretch of the imagination. That just goes to show you really need to test drive the vehicles you put down. It is quite sad that you limit yourself to the overpriced, poorer reliability of BMW and MB as your only options as true luxury vehicles."
4647,nyccarguy,September 2011,"I agree with you 100% fedlawman. Even though my 2010 TSX is equipped with an automatic, it is the best automatic I've ever driven. It holds shifts in M(anual) mode until I (the driver) flicks the paddle on the right for it to upshift. Even in S(port) mode, as long as my foot is planted, the revs will keep climbing to the redline before the transmission upshifts.  I've heard the TSX with a 6-speed stick is an absolute blast to drive. We've already got one car in our fleet that my wife cannot drive (my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH). When we bought the Acura, it was supposed to be her car (replacing our dearly loved 2007 BMW X3). Since we found out child #3 is on her way, we bought my wife a Pilot & I inherited the TSX.  Is my TSX perfect? No. Like our resident 1st generation TSX owner says ""the wrong wheels are driving the car."". I don't like the electric power steering.  Those who say it is ""just a rebadged Accord"" need to drive the 2 cars back to back."
4648,nyccarguy,September 2011,"Back in 2009 I drove an Accord EX-L w/ NAV & a TSX w/ Tech Pkg. Both had almost identical sticker prices. While the Accord's V6 had ""more punch,"" the TSX's I4 was much smoother. The suspension is tuned much more taut in the TSX. The TSX has stiffer anti-roll bars.  It is definitely a car you have to drive to appreciate.  I'm not saying the TL isn't more of a driver's car with it's 305 hp V6 & SH AWD. It's price of admission is significantly higher than the TSX. It also didn't meet the gas mileage requirements of the cash 4 clunkers program.  For the record, I dig ""the beak."""

Totally different cars- you should try them.  ""The main reason Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in Japan, they don't really exist."" trying to hard?? what are you saying here?? hello- all 3 of these brands have been around for 20 years.. they have sold millions of cars and have huge amounts of brand cred across the world."
4650,plekto,September 2011,"You do realize that vehicles from the 5-Series below and E-Class below are not even considered luxury over in Europe?  Absolutely. What's amazing is that we consider an Accord with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here. Now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit jaded over there, but you'd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the U.S. Not re-badged Accords and Buicks and the like.  Perhaps we've been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic. The TSX might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware. To consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts. Front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the V6, dead steering feel, and, well, the list goes on and on. If you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you.  As for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more. They now all make large luxury cars with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.  Here's a challenge: Find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. If 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat. No, the 911 does not qualify, obviously. It must be rear wheel drive. It must be under 3000lbs. It must be sporty. Not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.  And that's before we add the luxury requirement to the mix.  Can anyone here find one? Really. Maybe I forgot some vehicle or something? Everything I find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier. Even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category. (since the E36 was 3200 lbs, this is as heavy as I'd consider) ****"

It was whether those brands were known world-wide. Lexus were active in Europe pretty much from launch. Infiniti was conceived as more of a US brand. Infiniti cars weren't sold officially in Europe until 2008. When I left the UK in 2002, cars that were labelled Acura in the US were sold with a Honda badge in Europe."
4657,m6user,September 2011,"Are the Hondas sold in Europe the exact same car as the Acuras sold here in the US? When I say exact I don't mean safety because there are obvious differences due to those regulations, but are they the same level of, for want of a better word, luxury. If so, what kind of prices are these cars being sold for in Europe? Maybe the Honda as we know it here wouldn't even sell in Europe because they would be too low rent so to speak."

A guy driving around in a 5 series here might get waved at by European tourist thinking its a cab-big deal, culture clash. We live here, lets keep our focus here."
4659,smarty666,September 2011,"Of course its a challenge, because the criteria you place on a sports sedan is absurd. I never said the TSX is a sport sedan but the G37 and 3-Series most certainly are. You will find few people who will argue otherwise. I didn't realize that the 16inch and 17inch wheels offered OEM are needlessly large tires? I suppose some 14 inch ones would be better :P  The problem is, you and many others place too much emphasis on what the rest of the world is doing in the car market. Who cares what is and what is not offered in Japan, or Germany, China, Korea, etc. Who cares that Lexus, or Infiniti, and Acura are not everywhere around the globe. What matters is they are here and have been for some time now. All that matters is what we are offered here and what we get to choose from. In my life, I have had plenty of mainstream division cars and luxury division vehicles, trust me, there is a big difference between the two.  Unfortunately, people such as yourself, go in at bat with the mindset that they are just rebadged junk and not worth the money, but there is more than just the name and price. It is nicer materials, better put together body, longer warranty, better dealership experience, etc and some other perks you get at the luxury companies than the mainstream. I've seen it first hand from many different makes, both American, German, and Japanese."

In fact, just about all compact SUVs have lousy lease deals. So, that, coupled with her now working from home (a lot less miles driven) is leading us to possibly purchase a vehicle...  Top candidates are:  Volvo XC60 Audi Q5 VW Tiguan  But, we just acquired an E30, so she can drive my son's Legend, after her lease is up.... for a month or so... if we haven't found a replacement by the end of October.. so, I'm not pressed for time...  regards, kyfdx"

Drove out of the city - south and east, then west into Austria. Stayed overnight in Krimml.  Saturday, 17 Sept. &#150; Hiked around Krimml Falls and then crossed the Gerlos Pass \ Alpine Road and headed toward Innsbruck. Turned south and stayed the night in Verona, Italy.  Sunday, 18 Sept. &#150; Drove south to a B&B located in a tiny village [ Pitelli ] near La Spezia.  Monday & Tuesday, 19 & 20 Sept. &#150; Toured Cinque Terre villages.  Wednesday, 21 Sept. &#150; Toured a couple of other local tiny villages, right on the La Spezia area coast = S. Terenzo and Lerici.  Thursday, 22 Sept. &#150; Drove north to Switzerland. Stayed overnight in San Bernardino.  Friday, 23 Sept. &#150; Drove north then east to Memmingen, Germany. Toured the old city in the afternoon.  Saturday, 24 Sept. &#150; Briefly toured other areas close to the hotel in the morning and enjoyed the local farmers&#146; market. Drove to Munich Airport & flew back to the US.  Overall comments: This was a terrific experience for my daughter and me. We were very fortunate, weather-wise. We had some rain overnight the first night, but it cleared by mid-morning. It rained cats & dogs & buckets during the latter part of the drive to the La Spezia area, and was quite windy much of the overnight &#150; but it cleared by morning, and that resulted in more surf than one would expect on the Mediterranean coast, while we toured the Cinque Terre villages. The scenery and the weather those days and driving while in Austria and Switzerland were almost literally breathtaking.  Oh, and the BMW 335iS Coupe [ Le Mans Blue, Gray, DCT ] ran flawlessly the whole time &#150; just over 1,000 miles. Counting the days now until [re-]delivery.  I plan to post details in the CCBA forum about several of the days, with links to photographs on photobucket &#150; but that may take another few days.  Cheers, - Ray Happy BMW driver . . ."

4671,plekto,September 2011,"Some models list weight (almost certainly dry weight) and some ""curb weight"". You also have to add in supplies and so on (chains, battery cables, maps, etc). Some cars don't include the spare tire in the weight as well, as it's optional."

Same goes for most models.  Ray...congrats on the new car. Would also love to hear about the delivery."
4674,markcincinnati,September 2011,"I am pretty well convinced that my 2012 TL will outperform my 2009 A4 2.0T, too. The Audi, which has Audi Drive Select, can be put into ""dynamic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. It has 19"" wheels with Ultra High Performance Yoko S.Advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).  It has rear wheel drive biased quattro and last but not least has 211HP and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.  It, the Audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.  The TL isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase. It is nose heavier than the Audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not Ultra High Performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased AWD, but also includes torque vectoring. It feels a bit softer than the A4, it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305HP and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.  The Audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the Acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305HP allows the Acura to always show the Audi its tail lights.  My Audi, all in, was $49K (MSRP) The Acura, just south of $48K -- at these prices power rules. And, overall the Acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seats (that the Audi lacks).  Said it before, irrational as it might be, if the Audi were the same lease price per month as the Acura (that is about $200 less), I would have gone with another Audi -- just for that special something that only a German car seems to offer.  Irrational.  Couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. I am overall quite pleased with the Acura and if they continue to improve and move forward AND keep their value prop, well, I could become a TRUE BELIEVER.  You know, though, any of these cars are pretty damn nice.  :surprise:"

I'm averaging about 24 MPG on my 335i (which amazes me even more). I don't baby my cars, either.  These cars have come far."
4676,nyccarguy,September 2011,"graphicguy & markincincinati - I think the 2 major things you'll both notice that are different between your current & former TL SH AWD & current BMW & Audi are:  Steering. Having never driven a TL SH AWD, just my 2010 TSX, I can tell you the electric power steering stinks. Road feel is non-existant at low speeds. At higher speeds it is really nice and tight though.  Brakes. There is a reason that my TSX is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment. Acura honda had to cut corners somewhere. The brakes on my TSX are terrible. Nothing at all like BMW's RIGHT NOW brakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.  Obviously power is different too. Mark's Acura is definitely faster than his former A4, while graphicguy's 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal cars on the road"
4677,tlong,September 2011,"I had a 1998 A4 (6 cyl) and have an '05 TL. Differences between the two:  - TL has more electronic goodies (but 7 year newer car) - TL poorer handler, wallows in turns - TL's climate control much quieter - Audi interior clearly nicer - Audi control feel and driving feel clearly better - Audi inspired much more passion - Audi extremely expensive to maintain, the few things that broke were a LOT - Acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain"
4678,sweendogy,September 2011,"Breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura tsx less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the accord platform. Its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the TL, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) Closest to the germans is Infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) . Cars from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with MPG mandates - I know BMW will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, Acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with MB for its next line of engines, should be interesting."
4679,nyccarguy,September 2011,"I might be mistaken, but off the top of my head the only other Honda Product that uses the exact same motor (2.4L - 201 hp - 176 lb/ft torque) is the Civic Si.  I'll agree with you that under extreme circumstances, my TSX shows it's Accord Platform roots. We have some seriously twisty back roads here in southwestern Connecticut. There's one particular road where the sign shows ""S"" curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit. My TSX shows the flaws in it's chassis.  Like many here have said, price aside, I'd choose a BMW.  Every single car in this segment shines in it's own way. A 3 series equipped like my TSX (or even a TL) costs significantly more, has a smaller back seat, & a smaller trunk.  The 3 series is sharper, handles better, drives much better overall."
4680,fedlawman,October 2011,"I've never driven a Jetta GLI so I can't comment on it. I think it's (a lot) smaller than the TSX and doesn't have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. I do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.  The TSX weighs less than any version of the A4 Audi makes. It's also lighter than the G25 and IS250. And Honda's I-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors V-6 motors.  The TSX is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. The switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below Audi but certainly as good as or better than Infiniti, Lexus, and BMW.  Plus, if you do own a 2004 6MT TSX, then you know the joy of revving that Honda I-4 up to 7400 RPM - only BMW's legendary I-6 is as satisfying to wind up.  And talk about keeping pace - the TSX has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and Infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more HP and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! Acura must be doing something right to inspire Infiniti and Lexus to build such close competitors.  Every car in this segment has an Achilles heel. The TSX is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ELLPS for the money. But if you want more than 200HP, then obviously it's not the right choice."
4681,sweendogy,October 2011,"Govt mpg mandates have a lot to do with why Infiniti and soon BMW are taking down hp. I dont think it has anything to do with acura inspiration. Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge, sure it has nice leather innards but the ergonomics are subject to personal taste. , As edmunds stated in the article the gli slightly beats it as a sport car. I know the sweet vtexh and it's great action manual (whicjlh I hope stays)- but the tsx has only gotten fatter over the years - with no power boost - 90% of them are automatics and it's currently sitting in a stale stable. I'm looking for a recent article that mentions this car as being a sports sedan, one published in the last 3 years."

4683,fedlawman,October 2011,"""Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge.""  You forgot to mention that the TSX is physically smaller inside and out and has a 4"" shorter wheelbase. It has a higher compression engine with a higher redline and 10 more HP. The TSX also has a beefier rear sway bar, high performance tires, sport suspension, sport seats, and a 6-speed MT."
4684,fedlawman,October 2011,"""2 car and driver articles -- again the acura in the middle of the pack vs cars that are not considered lux cars.""  Some TSX quotes from your first link...  ""Such a treat to drive this car after herding some of the others around the course. So much more certainty, so much more precision."" ""This is a case of all the parts working togetherâ&#128;&#148;quick responses, crisp steering, excellent brakes, minimal body roll, and it's all so easy."" ""Just brimming with confidence. Even on a long, dull interstate, you can feel the athletic tension of the chassis, all ready to burn up some twisties. Bravo!""  ""As much as we love this car's precision, refinement, and athletic nature, every story we've published about it has made some sort of apology for its relatively modest power... But in this comparison, the power shortage was costly.""  Your second link features the V-6 TSX, which is a nose-heavy, numb-steering pig. Not the car I'm talking about. They said it themselves...  ""The TSX V-6 is a smart cookie that just needs to lighten up a little. Which is code for, â&#128;&#156;Stick with the manual-transmission, four-cylinder TSX.""  So it looks like Car & Driver agrees with me. The 4 cylinder TSX with 6MT is the jewel of the Acura lineup and a superb ELLPS."
4685,sweendogy,October 2011,"beefier rear sway bar and all season highperformance tires-ok in other words things you can get at your local autozone.. sport suspension well thats subjective and no where on the acura website does it say sports suspension.  the car and driver articles you mention did not bash the TSX but they did say the other cars were better given its middle of the pack results. 2 vws and an accord were considered better cars for the price, ELLPS hahaha. I agree that with you that its the jewel of the acura brand-- but that brand includes the RL and ZDX :confuse:"
4686,fedlawman,October 2011,"Well, if you really believe that, then you can't be taken seriously here."
4687,sweendogy,October 2011,??
4688,fedlawman,October 2011,So you seriously believe that the Accord and Sonata are ELLPS's?
4689,fedlawman,October 2011,"You know, I remember the discussion when the TSX first came out in 2003. Back then, it was the Mazda6 owners who challenged that the TSX wasn't a ""luxury"" car and the Mazda6 was superior because it had ""similar amenities"" and a more powerful V6 (a recurring theme...).  Well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the TSX possesses in spades that more pedestrian cars lack.  All you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the Sonata and you immediately know it is an economy car. One drive and you instantly feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.  The Accord is another beast altogether. The Accord is arguably ""luxurious"" enough to compare with the bottom of the ELLPS class. It does lack some features expected here like Xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importantly, it lacks a sporting character. It is a big car - softly sprung with flat seats. The precision and refinement are there, but it doesn't have the dynamics of a sport sedan.  Yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (Last year, I equipped my Volvo with Bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).  So why try to shoehorn the Accord into a category it wasn't designed or suited for when Honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ELLPS segment? A nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific engine and gearbox with a modicum of luxury?"
4690,sweendogy,October 2011,"i never said that- but I did say the TSX should be moved from this group- it has not ""advanced"" with the rest of the group and in comparison tests it gets beat by ""lesser"" cars - in 2003 it was a player but that was 9 years ago."
4691,fedlawman,October 2011,"I agree that it hasn't advanced in horsepower, but I don't think that alone defines this class."
4692,sweendogy,October 2011,"HP alone no - but what have they done to improve on the early TSX? more lbs, a v6 that no one buys, a sportwagen, lets not forget about the 5 speed auto."
4693,tlong,October 2011,"I actually like the older TSX a LOT better than the new one - heavy, numb, and bloated like how all Hondas and Acuras have been heading lately."
4694,fedlawman,October 2011,"I agree. But how is BMW any different?  The 328i is the same E90 introduced in 2005 (MY2006), only it has 15 more HP and weighs 100 lbs more. It is eclipsed in HP by several cars in this segment, but it soldiered on. Why? Because it sells.  It is the entry point into BMW luxury and prestige. For Acura, the TSX is the entry point into the ELLPS segment. And it sells - warts and all."
4695,sweendogy,October 2011,"the current tsx has also gained in weight vs the 2004-2008 model-- how many lbs well 150-- it also lost 4 hp somewhere and gained gained 8 lbs of torque during that time period. So from what you presented BMW is different --yep they added HP and weight, not vice versa. they have also tweeked it a bit since the last refresh-- and are due for another one in 2012 prob a reason why it sells...would love to see a post of something that can merit the agrument besides the fact that you own this car- one time..-a comparo test or a current write up about the sport you talk of.. it was a long time ago when they started this ELLPS blog.. maybe its time for an update with current players-- And it sellls? well it sells better then any other Acura for sure infact its almost half of all acura sales at a total of 32k units for 2010, that is in the us, canada and mexico -- but bmw sold 100k (us only sales) 3 series cars and infiniti also sold 58k of the G series (US ALONE). So i think the warts are showing more then you think."
4696,nyccarguy,October 2011,"There are so many cars out there that aren't fantastic at one thing, they don't look good on paper, but they are great cars to drive. My TSX is one car that falls into that category. It's 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race. You really have to drive a TSX & a V6 Accord back to back. They ""are not"" the same car.  You seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various Internet site. It's like some people who say ""why do I need to spend $XX,XXX more for an M3 (or S4) when I can just chip my 335i (or A4 2.0T) for $X,XXX and get just as much or even more power?"".  There's also a company out there that makes a bolt-on supercharger for a V6 Mustang. It makes the V6 good for 475 horsepower. If you were in the market for a Mustang, would you buy a 5.0 GT or a V6 and get it supercharged? I'll take the V8.  I'll agree with you and fedlawman that the TSX V6 is a nose heavy pig. I personally don't think it needs to be in the Acura lineup. A V6 TSX has a sticker damn near a FWD TL & Honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the V6 TSX to sell it. I have the sane gripes with C&D regarding its electric power steering. The original TSX was a smashing success for Acura. I think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units. How many did they sell that 1st year?  You have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market. I believe the 2 main gripes (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modest power output. They made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a V6 option (whic doesn't sell well & adds weight & torque steer)  Anything the ""tuner crowd"" says Acura should use from it's parts bin will ruin the car's driving characteristics & appeal. ""Give it SH AWD"" adds weight, cost, & complexity. ""Give it the 4cyl Turbo from the RDX"" adds cost, complexity, & weight. Not to mention torque steer as well.  Part of the TSX's charm & appeal in this ELLPS segment is it's price point which it gets from being built on an Accord platform (or being an Accord from the rest of the world), it's 201 horsepower 4 cyl engine, 5 speed automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8 speed auto, that'll cost you too), low weight, the fact that Acura even OFFERS a slick shifting 6-Speed manual transmission.  Try walking on to your local BMW, Audi, MB, Lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,C,A4,IS have MSRPs under $40,000. Yes I know you can order your car any way you like it. Acura gets you into the door of this segment.  Like fedlawman said, drive it against an IS250 & G25 to tell me it isn't competitive and doesn't belong. Ive never driven a G25, but have driven an IS250 AWD (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & it's 201 horsepower V6 accelerates about as fast as a Toyota Yaris. The TSX's base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to it's 7,000 RPM redline. I can tell you it has a certain Germanic ride quality to it. Very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph."
4697,sweendogy,October 2011,"acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura -- OR they would sell more to the real sports fans-- pretty simple-- how many of those TSX leases out on LONG ISLAND are leased with manuals, NYC carguy?? If you want a BMW you can order a base 328 or 128 with a manual and it will outperform this TSX in every way. No one is talking about the tuner crowd here or even the IS or the G25, infact if you were watching last posts you would see the jetta and accord are now comps. We are talking about a car that has not changed in over 10 years except get bigger and heavier thus killing its sporty nature which is why it was in the EELPS but no longer should be considered."
4698,m6user,October 2011,"acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura  Just what percent of BMWs, A4s, C300s, Gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies? I'm pretty sure it's very close to the percentage you attribute to ""non-sports"" cars. Just because they are offered doesn't mean that they sell that many. I think I read somewhere that even BMW is only about 10% sticks. I don't think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor as you keep saying over and over and over again. I also know some pretty darn good car drivers that don't drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they can't drive well.  As far as the TSX goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority. Edmunds, when comparing to the GTI, said it wasn't as good a sport car or something like that. But, they did put it in the same category."
4699,sweendogy,October 2011,ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here- anything published besides your thoughts would be of great value- the car rags or anything that can substanciate your claim- lets be serious here- the TSX is a great entry level car for someone who is looking for value luxury not sports sorry..  i love the fact that you guys are defending this once great value but again when compared to its true comp its not really the value it once was. Now if you include acura as a brand behind this car it validates my claim - they are nowhere when it comes to sport. They are behind every other major comp in almost every category and have been happy for years being an OK (middle of the road) company.
4700,markcincinnati,October 2011,"To get an Audi in the A4 body style WITH torque vectoring (aka Sport Differential), one would need to move up the ladder to the S4 -- and, typically, the one with the Sport Differential and Audi Drive Select, etc, etc, etc, will be closer to $60,000.  I was very pleased to get an all tarted up TL Advance SH-AWD with accessories for under $48K -- and although it still isn't an S4, it presents itself very well in the class of cars we go on about here as well as being able to perform with near S4 capabilities.  I'm still in my loaner TSX -- and wondering why Acura doesn't offer the thing with SH-AWD; seems it would be a killer car based on what -- a $2,000+ bump for the AWD? :confuse:"
4701,nyccarguy,October 2011,"I think be because the TL is the bread & butter of the Acura lineup. Acura probably doesn't want the ""lesser"" TSX to steal sales from the TL. The TSX is Acura's entry level car (that actually has more trunk space than the TL). They want you to buy (or lease) a TSX, then trade up to a base TL a few years later, then to a TL SH AWD not too long after that, & be so happy with the cars/brand that you buy (or lease) an MDX for your wife every few years.  A V6 TSX Tech Stickers for high $30's. Add SH-AWD to that and you've got a close to $40K TSX. Maybe come trade up time you say ""I like my TSX SH-AWD, but don't think the TL SH AWD warrants the price jump."". Maybe you go look at Infiniti or BMW or MB...  I'm not comparing the cars, but kinda like the reason Porsche messes with the Cayman's gearing and won't give it too big a motor to protect the 911."
4702,tlong,October 2011,"The TSX V6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base TL to buy a TSX V6 with a similar MSRP (even though the V6 TSX is loaded with incentives most of the time).  Where does the TSX go from here? You can't give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy. You can't give it Acura's SH-AWD because that will add weight and price.  IMHO where they should go from here is to the previous model TSX, which was great before they numbed and bloated it up."
4703,sweendogy,October 2011,Dido - the tsx was great in it's early form or even integra form. Value plus sport - newer models are bloated like Josh Beckett/ sired they perform good but will never beat a good team with the playoffs on the line.
4704,nyccarguy,October 2011,"I agree the Acura is much more refined than the Infiniti. I had an opportunity to drive my Uncle's G37X sedan. Besides being an absolute road rocket, I was ultra impressed with the car's balance & handling. Felt like the car was turning on an axis."
4705,graphicguy,October 2011,"nyc.....I've made a couple of stabs at testing a G. They're good cars. They kind of cover the gamut. The G25 targets the TSX, probably an A4 and a 328i. The G37 seems to target 335i. I believe the TL SH AWD is up the ladder a little from the G, however. While the G37 is fast, I feel my 335i is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. Refinement in both the TL and the 3 are much higher than in the G.  So, as mentioned before, the G tries to cover a lot of ground.  My fear (and one of the main reasons I bought the '11 3) is that BMW is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. Nothing inherently wrong with that. Audi's been doing that for years with their A4. But, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.  Mark...I tried to find an S4 at both The Audi Connection and in Dayton. All they had were used ones. As you say, you get about 95%+ of an S4 in the TL SH AWD, for a whole lot less money. Interesting enough, the Cincinnati Audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new cars....a few A4s, a few A6s....one A7 and a splattering of the Qs. Nothing that grabbed me. And, I went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. The guys at Beechmont had 3-S4s, and a whole lot of A4s, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my TL SH AWD when push came to shove.  Now, if either of them had stocked an A5 or S5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. The only A5s they had were convertibles and I don't think the new S5 was out yet."
4706,markcincinnati,October 2011,"The Audi Connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the European (at least the German) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. No instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""let's go buy a new car. . .TODAY!"" and we're off to the races.  We leave our houses late on a Saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a Chinese restaurant for some take out.  Sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at Lowes.  The Germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)  I was lucky that the AC had a basically stripped S4 in stock a few months ago (an '11). It didn't even have nav (at THAT price). It had the DSG tranny and it had, apparently, HUGE urge. It felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the A4 (non sport) or the TL, although at full cry the TL's 3.7L motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the A4 2.0T). The great thing about the Audi's is that they use FSI and are either Super or Turbo charged. Imagine for 30 seconds what the TL 3.7 SH-AWD would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5L now enjoys.  Acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""TL/S"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (Brembo's with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. Perhaps it could move the AWD bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/S"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only Acura aficionados would appreciate.) I'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the Advance 19"" wheel, only different.  Perhaps this would add too much to the MSRP and the Acura Advantage (VALUE) would, for many, vanish and they would get the SLine A4 or the S4 or the Volvo S60 R Design, or even the Bimmer.  I would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented TL. After all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- Lexus for pity's sake, LEXUS!  Sir your High Performance La-Z-Boy is ready. Never thought THAT would happen!  C'mon Acura -- you've clearly got some great engines (thinking of Indy cars, for example) in your DNA, let 'em out. Let My people go.  :surprise:"
4707,flightnurse,October 2011,"The price of the G cars have gone up to a point that makes a BMW is better choice. For the price of my 2011 328i out the door, was the same price for a base G37, my 328 isn't a base car. So price was the advantage of the G car but that isn't happening today. So why would someone get a G37 when you can get a BMW for the same price... The BMW for me is a much more refined car then the G, and the Car mag's have stated the same thing."
4708,markcincinnati,October 2011,"The G37, from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.  Go on-line to Infiniti and select a G37 or 37X (and you can, if you like even go for the ""S"" models). Crank the options to 11 and you will find the G remains available with an MSRP that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328HP engine and Premium Package, Navigation Package, Sport Package, Technology Package, Interior Accents Packge, Rear Decklid Spoiler and Midnight Black Grille Package, Splash Guards, Stainless Steel Illuminated Kick Plates, LED Daytime Running Lights and Interior Accent Lighting all for an MSRP of: $46,940.  This car IMHO is not comparable to a BMW 328.  Now, I am not in any way suggesting that the BMW is not a ""superior"" vehicle (Car & Driver, despite loving the G, loves the BMW even more). Many magazine writers do opine that Infiniti's G37 and G37X are Japanese Bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the G in the #2 spot.  Well, hell, try to equip the comparable BMW 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the G above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the BMW's MSRP under $50,000.""  Again, I am not suggesting that the BMW is #2 in this contest -- I am simply suggesting that a G equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the Bimmer would probably show the Infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.  But if you're looking for VALUE, the Infiniti must be at the top of the list.  A G37 (X or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7L motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a comfortable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.  For the price, the Bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, I said ""for the price.""  Additionally, the G's have very very attractive lease programs -- often better than BMW's attractive programs.  :shades:"
4709,billyperksii,October 2011,Mark- you are funny- I like your style of writng.
4710,fedlawman,October 2011,"""IMHO where they should go from here is to the previous model TSX, which was great before they numbed and bloated it up.""  I agree."
4711,fedlawman,October 2011,"""I've taken a couple of stabs at liking Infinitis. None of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" list. I think they lack the refinement I got used to with Acuras, BMWs ,etc.""  I think you hit the nail on the head.  To me, Infiniti's seem like second rate BMW's. The G37 is fast and handles well, but they haven't nailed down the refinement.  Acura, on the other hand, stays true to being a characteristically Japanese sport/luxury car. There's no attempt to try to be anything but what it is.  By the way, is that you over at AVS talking about the 4311?"
4712,sweendogy,October 2011,"Hasnt nailed down refinement. - I agree not as refined as an Audi of BMW - and I do agree the Acura is more refined like lexas then the Infiniti G_ but interns of performance Acura has nothing compared to Infiniti. Acura stays true- sure they are true to compete with the Lexus Es. Not BMW. Sorry way wrong- they have not produced a car in 10 years that was sport- NsX died a long time ago so did the Acura ""sports"" claim. I would also wonder what Honda does with this brand- no hybrid, no coupe, no convert, no sports supercar, no flagship sedan- look at all the leaders, Audi, BMW, Lexus. They have all of these - Acura not one. This could be the next Oldsmobile. ( write that down)"
4713,smarty666,October 2011,"I agree, the price of the G has risen a little bit over the last few year, but I don't agree that the best bang for your buck is the BMW, yet that is. The G37 compares to the 335 and not the 328. If you did make the comparison you are, your 328i is going to lack almost 100hp, bi-xenon headlights, navigation, and a couple of other little toys and tech you only get in the 335 when ordered that your getting for the same price in the G37. I do agree though that the BMW is more refined then the G, but definitely not the best bang for the buck yet.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next gen 2013 G and 3 series. It should be interesting to see what Infiniti and BMW do with their bread and butter vehicles."
4714,kyfdx,October 2011,"Stopped by to look at the G series today.... we were a little too ragged out to drive one....  But, they have decent lease deals.. 39mo./39K lease on a G37X with premium pkg (MSRP about $41K) for $440/mo.+tax.. with around $900 total due at signing.. Add sport package for another $10/mo.  That's better than Audi or BMW, right now.. and.. 328 HP..."
4715,flightnurse,October 2011,"Yes the G37 has 100 more HP, but as I wrote what I paid for my 328 is very close to the base price of a G37, there is no way you are going to get Nav, bi-xenon headlights or other goodies that I have on my 328 in that G37. The base price for a G37S is far more then what I paid for my 328i.  Now if one wants to compare the average price of a 335i to a G37S the BMW is better value."
4716,sweendogy,October 2011,"which base did you beat the G37 which is 37k even or the 41500 for a fully loaded G37S-- you lost me because you mentioned both..with haggling you can get a G for 2-4k off each car given the dealer. how much did you pay, was this a cpo?  does your car have the sports package, navi, rear camera like the G37s has? does your car have the headlights, sunroof, leather, and paint (500bux extra for Bmw) that the G37 base has?  I dont have the avg price people are paying for the 335 or the G37S but given the options that are standard on the G its got to be close to 8k..maybe more--i own a G and want a 335-"
4717,m6user,October 2011,Just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equipped(as I could get) was about $5k more than the G37x. Plus you get the +100hp to boot with the G. The 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value it's hard to beat the G. Infinitis are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part. I have one(QX4) that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairs(exhaust resonator and power antenna) other than scheduled maint.
4718,smarty666,October 2011,"Nah, they are taking 4k off a fully loaded G37 at my two local Infiniti dealers and I'll bet it is similar in discounts your received on your 328i so the G still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the 328i. Also a G37 is fully loaded with nav, sport, etc for around 44k, before any discounts. It still undercuts the 335i in price. As almost all the 335i my local BMW has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s. The G even undercuts that price.  I'm not saying the 328i or 335i are bad vehicles, in fact I really liked them when I test drove both but they still don't compare to the bang for buck of G."
4719,wireless,October 2011,Something I noticed this weekend when reading a somewhat favorable review of the 2012 Acura TL: They have a new 3.7L engine with 305 HP @6000 rpm and 273 pound-feet @5000 rpm.  How is it that the MB C350 (pretty much the same price) has a 3.5L and it has 302 HP @6500 rpm with 273 pound-ft @3500 rpm. One thing I would give Honda is that they were always able to wring the HP out of their small engines even if they had to rev them to 9k rpms. Now they need an engine almost 6% larger just to match MB and the peak torque is at a relatively high 5k rpm.

4721,flightnurse,October 2011,"The $1500 of performance upgrade was from Vishnu, not Dinan. BTW, when you have Dinan do any upgrades they inform BMW of this with your VIN #. Dinan does some ama$$ing work but the price for entrance is not to my liking. I know a couple of people with 335i's with the Vishnu products and never had an issue."
4722,markcincinnati,October 2011,"Acura chose a tire, I know not why, that has the distinction of being High Performance, not Ultra High Performance. It is an all season V rated Goodyear RS-A -- it has a tread wear of 240 or 280 or something pretty low for such a low-er performance tire."
4723,shipo,October 2011,"Yikes! Goodyear Eagle RS-As? Utter and complete crap in every sense of the word. :sick:  Those worthless donuts came from the factory on my current car and I had them yanked when there was only 714 miles showing on the odometer. I replaced them with a set of Michelin Pilot Sport A/S tires, and the immediate improvement in the handling and precidtiblity of my car was beyond my greatest expectations.  If you look around on the net you'll find any number of makes and models where Goodyear suckered the manufacturer into using the RS-A; the last time I checked the only positive reviews coming from any car community are remarks from the folks driving the Ford Crown Victoria shod with the RS-A. Not much of a ringing endorsement if you ask me. :P  Long story short, if you like your car now, you'll absolutely love it later, if and when you give it some new shoes. :shades:"
4724,smarty666,October 2011,"The RS-As are utter crap as a tire. They came on my Maxima and Nissan and Infiniti liked to use them on a lot of things. They used to come standard on the M, but at least they came to their senses after people complained and now the M comes with Primacy MXM4s."
4725,shipo,October 2011,"Funny thing, when I got my current car in the fall of 2008 the RS-As were way-way expensive, like twice the price of the vastly superior Michelin Pilot Sport A/S I replaced them with. Fast forward three years and they are literally less than half of the price they were back then (while the Michelin's have gotten much more expensive, and rightly so).  I cannot imagine what questionable business tactics Goodyear used to sell so damned many of these horrible tires to the vehicle manufacturers of the world. FWIW, you can add Mazda and Volvo to the list of companies which got suckered into buying the RS-A."
4726,markcincinnati,October 2011,"Not defending the tires, but the TL uses a ""new formulation"" RS-A. I still think they are crap, too, but there is something that allowed Goodyear to call them NEW.  Perhaps it is whatever has to be done to change their rating from H to V??"
4727,shipo,October 2011,"If I'm not mistaken, the Eagle RS-As that came on my car carried a ""V"" rating back in 2009. That said, I'll probably never be able to prove it one way or another as I was able to sell them within a week of having them yanked off of my car."
4728,billyperksii,October 2011,"Mark- drove my wife's 04 accord to work today, guess what- they have grab handles!!!! I guess everyone has their little gripes-me, I would never buy any car with less than a 245 18 tire size. I just like that wide looking stance."
4729,shipo,October 2011,"Yeah, why bother having a car with superior handling dynamics when you can have one which looks good? :P"
4730,markcincinnati,October 2011,"My TL has 245 x 40 x 19""'s which seem adequate -- or, better said, would be adequate if the tires were at least UHP's.  I assume Acura chose the RS-A's for two reasons:  #1 They got a deal from Goodyear, and #2 Customers didn't care for the Summer Only rubber that Acura had chosen previously.  Too many folks here and on all the other ""purpose"" sites [non-permissible content removed] and moan about the dearth (and death) of manual transmissions. Yet manufacturers, like Acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. If I were the manufacturer, I would seriously consider dropping something THAT unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)  Likewise, other good deeds don't go unpunished -- my 2009 Audi A4 with the 19"" sport package came with Max Performance Dunlops -- SUMMER only tires. My dealer claims they never stocked the A4 with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year 'round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc. So, no mo' UPH or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. And, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesn't come with A/S shoes.  The list of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin' -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.  Those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first pony up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. Case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an Audi A4, I first had to agree to buy the A4 configured as a Prestige model. No 19"" wheels for the proletariat.  Acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless I went with the Advance designation; now that I have the Advance, I am glad, since I also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated AND cooled) seats along with the BSW system.  Of course every manufacturer here in ELLPS land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications. Hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.  I'd like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their cars to be built; I'd also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices. Why is it that I couldn't get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but I could get crystal black with umber? Who's dumbass rule is that anyway?  The list of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to amaze. I guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these cars are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- TAKE THE CUSTOMER's MONEY for pity's sake!  Why are back-up sensors NOT a factory option on an Acura TL? My dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since I had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).  The dealer didn't make any money on THAT transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a FACTORY installed option.  Where was I? What time is it? Oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put RS-A's on the top o' the line TL?  Drive it like YOU live!  :surprise:"

4736,graphicguy,October 2011,"mark....billy....I have a dealer who I buy my Acura products from (if I'm in the market for an Acura). Any year, any color combo, any equipment level, any model. If they have to find one for me, they will. The deal is a skinny one.  Then again, I've bought 3 Acuras from the same dealership, same sales person. It's really simple dealing with them and I always get a good deal.  Same way with BMWs. I go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (who's been there for 24 years). If they don't have what I want, they'll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with BMWs, it seems). Again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle. And, I've also bought multiple BMWs from them.  I've never been able to deal with either the local Infiniti dealer, nor the local Audi dealer. Neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.  However, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the Infiniti dealers and the Audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.  Go figure.  Mark...you know the dealerships (Audi Connection, Infiniti of Cincinnati) I'm talking about. I don't even bother shopping the local Audi dealership anymore when I'm in the market. They don't have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer). Then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble.  The Infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesn't seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (Audi and Infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal). Maybe their focus is on leasing. But, I'm a purchase customer, not a lease customer.  That diamond white paint on the TL is super expensive. I had to have body work done on my diamond white TL and the shop that did the work said it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right. Hand it to Acura to pull off such a feat on a production car. It is stunning looking, however.  billy...I liked that umber interior. I almost bought one with that color. My Acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those cars with that interior color, they were hard to sell. So, I figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.  Mine had ""stone"" interior, which I liked quite a bit, too."
4737,graphicguy,October 2011,"me...I have ""park distance control"" (PDC)on my 3. I like it....more than I liked the back-up camera on my TL. I can get within 12-18 inches of another car or garage wall just by watching the park distance control in the NAV screen.  It was harder to judge distance with the back up camera.  I'm certain you have to have BMW's iDrive to get PDC. But, I've never seen an option to add it as a dealer accessory. Call your dealer and ask them."

4740,sweendogy,October 2011,"I understand that this is an agrument that I will lose as soon as the host comments but why not a Volvo s60 which was just updated, and has been marketed as a competitor to the cars on the right. My point is this was started 10 years ago and why not reshuffle the deck once a decade?"
4741,markcincinnati,October 2011,"Holy cow! I assumed the S60 was in this group -- until I double checked the top of the screen and saw no S60.  Is this an oversight -- we can debate until the cows come home the relevance of the TSX, but if the S60 is not here and the A4 and 3 and C class are, where in the world would the S60 be if not ELLPS? :confuse:  Finally IMHO there is no comparison of an A4 with a TSX that can withstand any serious examination -- now, then, compare an A3 vs TSX or a ""Deluxe"" Jetta or perhaps a new Passat with a TSX, sure.  But, sure, go ahead keep it here as an outlier."

4743,flightnurse,October 2011,"Reason why the S60 isn't talked about much is the fact the car redesign makes a statement in style, some people might not think of it as a contender. However this is changing, and soon it will be talked about. For me when I looked at buying my 328 I looked at Volvo on the same night I looked at the A4. The interior space on the S60 seemed smaller then the A4 for more money. Also the car isnt that sporty even in sport trim."

The host can correct me if I'm wrong.  So the S60 certainly can be included in the discussion IMO as well as the 9-5(at least for now???) and possibly others.  And of course I know the A4 has more torque. Some family sedans have more torque than the A4 so I hardly think that should be the only qualifier."

4750,Kirstie_H,October 2011,"That's exactly the issue - limited space. I believe at the time, models were chosen based on the higher-volume sellers or those for which we see the most consumer traffic/interest in the forums. The list isn't meant to be all-inclusive or limiting regarding what vehicles you can discuss - as long as the vehicle reasonably fits into the ELLPS class, it's fine to talk about.  Looking at the list, it seems we could replace the Mercedes C-Class with the Volvo S60. It *has* been updated - I remember taking out the G35 and replacing it with the G37."
4751,m6user,October 2011,"True or they could even replace the TSX as they already have the TL listed from Acura. That would satisfy all the people that seem to have a hang up with the TSX(they wouldn't see it displayed) but we can still discuss as a viable alternative. All these cars don't have to perform exactly alike or be priced the same to be in the same class. There always has to be a starting point in any category and I would suggest the TSX is that starting point. Is it as fast, handle as well, etc etc as many of the others? No, but it still belongs in the mix."
4752,fedlawman,October 2011,I would rather see the S60 take the place of one of the Lexus sedans. They are much more redundant than the TSX and TL.
4753,Kirstie_H,October 2011,"I agree - no sense in listing two very similar models. Most of our discussions across the forums about the IS250/IS350 are combined anyway, and it's not that much of a high-traffic model."

But listing a car that doesn't get much attention may be good thing as it would generate some discussion about it.
4755,renssils,October 2011,"After driving my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD with Advance package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, I can make a few observations. The car has been reliable, though lately it rattles, perhaps from the sunroof. The seats are comfortable. The HVAC and in-car electronics are excellent. On the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. The engine and transmission are both quiet and smooth.  Within 250 miles of my getting the TL at the end of April 2011, I bought a set of four Continental ContiExtreme DW summer tires, which are so much better than the OEM Goodyear tires. The TL on the Conti tires is fun to drive! The Contis stick like glue, are quieter, and smoother riding. Today in anticipation of winter, the Goodyears were installed on the TL; the Contis will be stored until next April. I will miss the Contis. I recall that the Goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. I hope that they'll perform well in shallow snow.  I've owned several high-performance all-wheel-drive sedans including a 2001 Audi A6 4.2 sport, a Subaru SVX, which is my all-time favorite, and two Subaru Legacy spec.B sedans. I was inclined to get a new Audi S4, but chose the TL after driving a BMW 535ix, Volvo S60 T6, and Infiniti M37x. The TL seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. The TL was appreciably less costly to lease than the other cars.  The TL delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. The forward visibility is atrocious. Thick, raked A-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. Rear visibility is severely limited. The back up camera has primitive software and furthermore rain on the camera's lens reduces its utility. The trunk is oddly shaped and small for a 194-inch long car; if you don't lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. The only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. The navigation system's system has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. The car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.  The TL is so close to being a fine car, but I wouldn't buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility."
4756,robbieg,October 2011,"I would think that in the real world few people actaully want a ""performance car"". Most people want a slush box and not a stick. Furthermore, at least in my next of the woods, people don't want a RWD BMW or Mercedes. They want AWD so it goes in the snow. In short, performance isn't that big of a deal.  The TSX is every bit as sporty as a CTS or the S60 if not more so. It seems people in this forum, which I have read on and off for years, care about a manual transmission and rear wheel drive. Well, few if any of those cars are sold in my area. Most BMWs are x-drive and with only a few manuals are actually sold."
4757,andres3,October 2011,"I'll agree the TSX belongs. If only for it's quality interior appointments and exacting assembly from Japanese artisans. I found it to be ""tighter"" than the USA built TL a few years back (previous generation models).  I had a 2003 Accord V6 and it's interior was best in class in my opinion, but the TSX clearly goes beyond anything Honda has or had in luxuriousness of the interior. I haven't driven a TSX so I can't speak on that, but I'm very familiar with the way Honda's drive, and would say that Honda/Acura have mastered the art of sporty FWD cars. FWD can be great when engineered correctly for sport and performance.  I currently drive a FWD Audi A3, and can say that Honda/Acura/Audi/VW are in their own league when it comes to sporty FWD performance.  I don't think anyone can touch them on Front Trak/FWD.  If your goal is to be fast, FWD can work. If your goal is to do powerslides and drift, FWD is a problem.  I think in the future I will prefer AWD. Absent the weight penalty, AWD rocks."

Assuming your car came with the same Goodyear Eagle RS-As that mine came with, I wouldn't get your hopes up too much. I bought my car in November of 2008, two days before a light dusting of snow, and the RS-As proved to be as bad in the snow as the Michelin Pilot Primacys which came on my last BMW (with the Sport Package which features summer tires).  Fortunately I'd been forewarned about the RS-As and already had a set of Pilot Sport A/Ss on order, and once they were installed after 714 miles, I sold the (virtually new) Goodyears for something like thirty cents on the dollar (and was happy to get that much for them)."

If one is going to plunk down $40+ for a TL or G37 and pay expensive dealer maintenance(at least Acura, I'll find out about Infiniti, first two services are free) and put premium in the car, then what is another $150/year for an XM subscription.

I agree, the engineering of the recording and the quality of the mastering and mixing matters more than the source itself.  There are bum DVD-A and SACD's just like their are incompetent regular CD's too.  A well recorded and mixed DVD-A or SACD will still be noticeably better than a well recorded regular old CD. The potential is just higher, and of course allows 5.1 mixing.  Fleetwood Mac's Rumours DVD-A is an example of a high quality mixing/mastering on the medium of DVD Audio."

The recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate.  Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and it's ""just"" DTS. On the other hand, I have some SACD's that sound like junk even though they're 24/192. The Police ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" sounds terrible.  Most of the time, I can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a Redbook CD and SACD even when listening carefully with headphones. In a car?!?! Forget about it.  The best thing about the Acura sound system is the surround sound. That's definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others.  Mark, do you have any Porcupine Tree DVD-A's? You must get some - they will blow you away!  Trying to remember who told me, but from a reliable source.......the ELS sound system in the TL-Tech is made by Pioneer. Why they don't brand it, I really don't know. It might be Acura's choice. I know for awhile, Acura was using car systems by Clarion, but the current ones that come with the tech packages (not sure about the source for their standard stereos) are from Pioneer.  Long and short of it, I think Acura used to use Bose, and advertised that they did (requirement from Bose, perhaps?). But, that was several years ago. Since then, they never advertise who makes their car stereos (same for Honda).  It's still the best car sound system I've ever listened to. That includes the HK system in my 335i (which is no slouch) and the B&O systems I heard in the Audis I test drove.  BTW...agreed on Porcupine Tree. Also see if you can find the DVD-A disk from Dishwalla called Opaline. Don't get the ""dual disk"" one, but the DVD-A version.  YES-Fragile is probably the best DVD-A I've ever heard.  Too bad that format never really took hold. Also too bad my HK system in the BMW doesn't play DVD-A disks, either.  I find the HK system in the BMW to sound better streaming from my iPhone than it does when Sirious or HD RADIO is the source."

4780,fedlawman,November 2011,"I like the quieter tracks best. I love ""Today/Tonight,"" ""Candleburn,"" and ""Drawn Out."" Great songs with simply stunning sound! A couple of the louder tracks sound a little compressed/congested in places when I play them at volume.  Mark - I hear some U2 and Coldplay in this album.  The weather already sucks here and my M is in semi-hibernation now (battery tender all week long).  That's surprisingly good fuel economy - neither of my cars (Volvo and BMW - both with significantly smaller & less powerful engines) do as well."
4781,graphicguy,November 2011,"fed....mark.....glad you like my recommendations. ""Today/Tonight"" is one of my favorite tracks, too. About 3 years ago, DTS was selling their own surround music disks on their own WEB site. I suspect they were getting out of the surround music biz in favor of the more popular (and more volume) DTS HD movie blu ray disks. Some interesting titles. Haven't listened to them in a while. Don't know if they're out of print or not. Have to dig them out.  My MPG is at 50-50 city/interstate. When I'm all interstate, it bumps up to about 28 MPG. All city driving is about 20-21 MPG. Pleased with all of it. Turbo 6 cyl, gobs of torque, no turbo lag, I'm liking it.  I still have to wonder how the BMW faithful will react to 4 cyl motors in the 2012 vs what has been years and years of 6 cyl offerings. I've read and heard of how ""wonderful"" the new 4 cyl engines are supposed to be. However, I don't know of anyone who's driven one yet (including the trade rags)."

I'm sure the new 4 will be smooth, but I doubt if it will match the refinement of the I-6. On the other hand, it will no doubt be much smoother and more refined than the I-4 and I-5 I currently own.  I'm going to have to research those DTS discs..."

4786,markcincinnati,November 2011,"I wanted (and still do) an Infiniti product. I love my wife's '11 FX35 Premium (in black with the Java interior) -- but, I didn't want to have 2 of the same thing and I absolutely had to have blind spot indication (coming from my '09 Audi A4 Prestige where it was standard equipment.) The only Infiniti that I could get that had BSI was the M and I had to order an M with BOTH Premium and Technology packages to get the BSI (and the tech package seemed to contain expensive automatic cruise control hardware and software that I did not see -- at this time anyway -- the value in.) I also shopped for a new A6, but the lease rates and the discounts offered were breathtaking (and not in a good way)!  So, I test drove the G37X with EVERYTHING on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic. Yet, the G could not be had with BSI -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track. The G has a track of 60.2"" and the TL is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the TL feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 A4.)  I probably would have gone with the G, despite the above, had it offered BSI.  Another contender was the Volvo T6 which could be had with BSI and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.  As someone said, to each his/her own -- the G just seemed cramped inside and somehow, compared to what I was used to, made me feel like I was a bug when I took it out on the Interstate (full of semi's).  Drive it like you live. :shades:"

4789,markcincinnati,November 2011,"What once were vices are now virtues. . . .  I never had TPMS until 2005 -- now, it too, is a must have (and it is now mandatory, so no longer a possible disqualifier.)  Got electronic stability control (branded ESP) in 2001, after thinking ""why would I need that, I've got ABS?"" -- then, after having it just one year, it became a must have, too (I understand it too will be no longer an option, this MY.)  Thought a back-up camera AND parktronic (aka backup sensors) were redundant -- now, after seeing the around view monitor PLUS front and rear parktronic (on my wife's Infiniti), I can hardly imagine not having AT LEAST a back-up camera and parktronic. Actually, I wish I had front and rear parktronic like my wife's 2005 and 2008 BMWs had on them.  Torque vectoring? Yep, it is rapidly overtaking both plain ol' Quattro and ATTESA as THE drive-line must have.  6,7,8 and more speed transmissions -- you guessed it: Must have.  Tires that auto-correct for under (or over) inflation: #1 Coming soon; #2 Must have (think of the billions of dollars of fuel alone this tech will save.)  Auto shut off and restart after full stop: ditto.  Heated AND Cooled (ventilated) seats: need you even ask?

I feel lost in the Acura, I have a nice cozy feeling in the G.  SH-AWD makes the Acura perform as well as the rest of the ELLPSs, over the FWD, as it is a nose heavy car, which is why I say it really hasn't moved forward.

4793,markcincinnati,November 2011,"Didn't forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made.  Hell, I grew up where only rich people's cars had A/C and power windows. My dad got a new Plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. And even though it was the top of the line Plymouth Satellite with a 318 V8 (the 383 and Hemi were reserved for the Road Runner and the 440 was for the GTX), it didn't have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket A/C which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the ""device"" (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.  The first time I got a car with power steering, brakes AND windows, I knew I had become a member of ""the club."" That car was a 1976 Chrysler Cordoba with fine Corithian Leather (how many remember that reference?)  It still had an AM only radio though, but with a speaker in the rear deck it was ""upscale"" befitting someone of my stature (in ""the club,"" of course.)  And, man o' man, when I got a car that had a rear window defroster (which was a slit in the rear deck through which air was blown by a motor located in the trunk), well, peel me a grape, Mabel.  Power door locks engendered a similar reaction when I got a 4-door car with FRONT only power door locks (and, as I recall, FRONT only power windows, too.) The dome light only came on when you opened a FRONT door, on this car -- probably saved $.50 per door to omit the rear on/off switch.  When I got an Audi with an infra-red remote (who's dumbass idea was THAT, anyway? -- infra-red, geesh) -- I had another grape peeling moment as well.  These days its power everything on virtually every car -- and even if you didn't want these assists, well, it would be virtually impossible to NOT have them.  My 1978 Audi 5000 was my first car with heated seats -- I used to take people for rides in the car and secretly turn on the seat heaters. . .why? Because back then heated seats were rare (and novel.)  I also didn't forget articulating headlights, nor did I forget bi-xenons (which the Acura TL lacks, strangely.)  Memories. . .memories. . . . :blush:"
4794,markcincinnati,November 2011,"You may be right about your longevity concern -- I really don't know. What I have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.  Perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- I would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter MOTOR?  In any case, I assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.  Somewhere I read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started COLD; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more MPG's, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. It is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of cars and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)  Fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell I watch too much TV) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of cars, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)  Mostly (which is NOT the same as entirely) I am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). When a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, I am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise:"
4795,kdshapiro,November 2011,"I remember when my father had an Audi 5000 and Audi 4000 side by side in the garage. After the 4000 he got a Legend. Yep, memories."
4796,shipo,November 2011,"Regarding the whole Start/Stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, I don't think it will affect engine longevity at all. Why? Because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.  Other fuel economy related thoughts:  I find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if I might be so bold, highly questionable. From my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. I'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power assist pumps, the A/C compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).  Remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. The only company which has announced such a research project is BMW; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later."
4797,graphicguy,November 2011,"I know there was quite a stir when the Hyundai Genesis came out. Don't know if it fits in this discussion, but I actually had test driven one when they first came out. Nice ""first"" effort at a lux car by Hyundai (they really should change their name for cars sold in the U.S.).  Well, I got my first chance to drive one for an extensive period of time. It was a rental (Enterprise). It was the 6 cyl model with what looked like the middle of the options package (everything but Nav).  First, it's a BIG car.  It drove fine....actually, it drove pretty good. I was in Milwaukee (OshKosh) WI with it when it snowed for the first time this Fall. It handled the snow and slush just fine.  The suspension that everyone bitched about isn't bad...at least not as bad as I had read about here at Edmunds. Yes, there are some road surfaces that cause an unrefined chassis feeling, but for the most part, it was fine....similar to a Mercedes E, without the unrefined part.  There were some things where hitting their price point caused some short cuts. If that's real wood in the cabin, the trees they used must have been very sick. The seats are....well....they're wide....certainly not very comfortable (and on the opposite end of the seats you'd find in the TL SH AWD or my 335i....both are great). The lighting is superb in the cabin.  They spend the money on the drivetrain, you can tell. The engine is responsive and sounds uber refined. The transmission shifts seamlessly and is ready to kick down when needed.  All the switches feel richer than they should, and operate with a smoothness that was unexpected.  All-in-all a nice first effort. Came close to mimicking the A6, Mercedes E, Lexus LS, (not really in the same category as a BMW 5 from both a dynamic and performance category). Not quite hit the nail on the head, but relatively close for a lot less money."

I pick based on value not like the masses (including yourself) who chases the trend. And by the way, whats wrong with the Millennia? Back in 2000 that car had all the goodies any other entry luxury car had to offer, leather, 17"" wheels, in dash 6 disc palyer, heated seats, fog lamps etc etc- it just did not have the luxury name that you tend to chase after."
4800,dino001,November 2011,"You didn't undestand the actual comments: 1. Putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company). If car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, GAP (included in lease) will pick it up. Other advantages are businesses don't need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer). That's why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads. Doesn't mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, it's generally bad idea, period. 2. People who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease. Lease is much more complex financing instrument with more variables that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price. There are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturer's bank has to eat the price difference).  One who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches. All of that has to be factored in. That's why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they can't afford the car (""don't deserve""). It really is a simple rule of thumb - if you can't afford to buy it (loan/cash), you can't afford to lease it, either. There are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doens't mean it's cheaper.  I went through it with my recent purchase. I got 328 wagon with a few options ($45K MSRP). Correctly structured lease (0 down, 15K/yr) was about $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total). To me $200 per month is absolutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan. I made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal. Higher monthly payments, but better deal overall. Now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but that's a different discussion."
4801,flightnurse,November 2011,"Go to the Infiniti dealer and ask to see the car that is advertise for that lease price. Changes are there isn't one around.. Leader Ad...  We can agree to disagree, you can put down $4K on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you can't really afford. I'll use BMW's money and put nothing down on a lease and use my $4K for my trip to Germany when we do the European Delivery of our 2012 535i"
4802,flightnurse,November 2011,"Thank you setting the record straight, there is also another factor that goes into leasing, is someone credit score, if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days, it wont happen. Just like what you wrote, those leader ad's will be for 10K miles a year on a 3 yr lease, how many people can drive that?"
4803,smarty666,November 2011,"Leasing really was a great alternative 5-6 years ago and I used to do it, but since then, the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it.  For instance, 5-6 years ago, my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it, you could without it breaking the bank. Some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout. That is no more. Now, the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees, etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them, thus never ending the cycle.  I found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease. It is going to be my last lease as I'm switching back to financing."
4804,smarty666,November 2011,You hit the nail on the head. I just sit and laugh when I see the leasing commercials from the car manufactures say things like $3995 or $4295 due at signing. That is just crazy!

4806,m6user,November 2011,"We can agree to disagree, you can put down $4K on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you can't really afford  What's up with you assuming to know what people can afford or not afford?  The act of putting money down on a lease has absolutely no indication as to whether the person can afford it or not. It may indicate that they either don't understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment. I don't think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"". It's kind of like the old saying that people that can't afford to buy the car will lease it. Kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female.  They could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these cars. Making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending!  Complete understanding of the leasing process and concern about all the possible risks involved indicates one is more knowlegeable.....not better off."

4808,dino001,November 2011,"I looked back at your post. At fist glance G37 looks better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments. I looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10K/yr (so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage, not on the road). However, Infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41K MSRP less $2.7K due is $38.3K, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4K, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer. BMW deal is structured around MSRP, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from. If you take out that 2 grand Infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar. In other words you walk into BMW and you can get your price down by a bit, but at Infiniti it's probably close to bottom line.  Add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things). I think it's a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but G37 being faster and perhaps better equipped)."
4809,sweendogy,November 2011,"I may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership I went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. Oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... Now mind you I own the car (not lease), only one driver and I do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. I'm sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but I think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that Infiniti would not fix it on the arm. For larger ticket items the BMW program sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away. (let's not forget the lease return fee as well)"
4810,dino001,November 2011,"Fat chance on those $40. There is no doubt BMW can get expensive at times. I don't kow prices at Infininti dealers, but all other lux cars (incl. Lexus or Benz) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so I find it unlikely Infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at Chevy, Ford or Toyota, not synthetic. A six pack of synthetic Mobil 1 is almost $40 at Costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. To balance, BMW has oil changes every 10-15K miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3K miles changes.  BTW, Infiniti has lease return fees. Directly from Infiniti website ""Disposition Fee due at termination of lease"". All lease companies do, no exceptions. They may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand.  I get it- you like Infiniti. Fine, there is a lot to like. Just don't oversell it. It is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe. Still 40 grand."
4811,sweendogy,November 2011,"Dino - I'm not selling anything I started this trying to clairify costs- that were posted by another who said BMW was had a clear advantage in leasing. clearly you don't totally get it. Do I think the g37 is a better car for my 40k vs a 328 sure- is it better them the 335 - nope but power and price are something I value for sure. Maintenance for a car is great but let's not get blinded by the fact that BMW does this for a reason- they want you to lease and this service helps them resell the car when it comes bac for a premium as certified- its a fantastic model of how to sell cars- and caddy has followed this lead. Oil changes - well click link, 40 bux - no that fat. Now you know.  http://herbchambersinfinitiofwestborough.com/Service_and_Parts_Specials"
4812,dino001,November 2011,"I clicked and I was right. This is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on BMW. So it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. This also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.  Again, G37 is a good car All I'm saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe. And I know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs . All I'm doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks. Manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage. Doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say.  Again: 1. Infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500. Lower BMW price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled. 2. Both have disposal fee. 3. BMW pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. Infiniti does not. Just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. Add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy. 4. Infiniti has better features and power. BMW has better resale. If you want comparable BMW, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.  Altogether BMW may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. In my town BMW dealers are far superior to Infiniti in customer service and sale experience."
4813,smarty666,November 2011,"Yeah, I'm going to have to call B.S. on those Infiniti service pricing as I never was quoted any where near that from my local Infiniti dealers for oil and filer and tire rotations. Those two always ended up over $100 bucks, hence why I went somewhere else to have that done."
4814,sweendogy,November 2011,"You can call it what you want but again a smart shopper knowing dealers have websites and competitors will shop around and get better. Look at the link I posted. Dino, Sure it's not synthetic but the 10-15k time period between changes seems a pretty long time between dealer visits for a 40k car- I guess if its a lease who cares right ?  Smarty you had an Infiniti? Weren't you the same guy talking up the TL as well? I think the with the 10 plus thou I saved not getting the 335 I can afford 3 dealer trips a year for oil."
4815,dino001,November 2011,"With BMW the car tells you when to go and change the oil. Has nothing to do with the lease. 10-15K is quite normal for regular use. BTW, it is very common in Europe - there nobody uses mineral oil, even on low-end subcompacts, but they do have much longer service periods. It really is just US, where 3K is still prevailing attitude at service stations. In turn, they put mineral oil even into engines that should never see it."
4816,flightnurse,November 2011,"Dino its not worth it, Sweeny is right we are all wrong, go back and read other postings of his and you will see a trend.  If Infiniti was the better car, then BMW wouldn't be in business. However when it comes to leasing, no one wins but the banks.  Just a FYI, BMW and Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, MB all drop the return fee if you lease another one of their cars, but BMW is the only one who will do it without asking. My First BMW I leased was a 325is and when I bought my 330i the fee was dropped and I never said a word."
4817,carnaught,November 2011,"My son recently returned his 2008 G35 after a 3 yr. lease. Although he did not lease or buy another Infinti, there was still no disposal/return fee. Review of his lease agreement confirms no disposal fee.  Has this then changed with newer Infiniti leases?"
4818,m6user,November 2011,"Please follow link for Infiniti oil change price of $25.95.  http://www.infinitilakecounty.com/specials/service.htm  I've owned an Infiniti for almost ten years and I don't believe I have ever paid over $35.99 for an oil change and of course that is not synthentic but it seems to work just fine for all this time. As I scan through my maint folder on the vehicle it seems it ran between $25 and $36 all these years. Can't account for the Infiniti dealer you frequented but I'm sure some are better than others. How many links are you going to need before you basically stop calling people liars? What does one have to do....scan and post invoices?  Um, oil changes at 3k? Who does that anymore. Most newer cars have a 7500 mile change schedule. If people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point what's the sense in trying to have a discussion.  Service prices have nothing to do with whether one car is better than another and I don't think that was the jist of this conversation anyway. Someone was just trying to point out the lease cost differences.....not whether one car is better or not."
4819,Kirstie_H,November 2011,"Pretty close to what I was paying for my G35 oil changes as well. I sure don't recall ever thinking, ""man, these oil changes are killing me!"" My VW Jetta oil changes were more expensive due to the filter. We have one vehicle that requires $90 oil changes, but it wasn't the Infiniti.  I will say that some of the maintenance items were pretty high, but I suspect they're in line with other vehicles in this class. Then again, I put 108,000 miles on it without a single repair (just maintenance), so overall it was a darn economical vehicle."
4820,rayainsw,November 2011,I did not order that option - too much $$s for too little use here. Had a portable w/maps for the trip. - Ray Managed to find where we needed to go.....
4821,billyperksii,November 2011,"No way Jose. I am quiet satisfied with the beak, 5 speed and rear. Secondly, why would I trade up for Blind Spot, Ventilated Seats and an extra gear? I know the value of money, the dealer would win, I would be left with a higher payoff balance and just for what-keeping up with the Jones? You need to get in contact with me and I will give you a few pointers on the value of money-remember Economics 101? Be content with what you have, your day will come for a upgrade."
4822,nyccarguy,November 2011,"How right you are. So many people ""upgrade"" their vehicle for the wrong reasons & cannot afford to do so. They'll dump their gas guzzling SUV for a fuel efficient Hybrid to ""save money on gas,"" but don't take into account the cost of depreciation. Or they'll trade in their current ride for one that has a lower payment, not counting the fact that they now have an additional 5 years of payments to make."
4823,sweendogy,November 2011,"Never said you should upgrade to the new TL just pointing out your current state, Acura sold the 2011 Tl for only a few months before launching the 12 because it wanted to move on and advance the brand. But did you say bonus season is coming and you wanted a e63 or e550? Being such a hitter I thought you'd be able I withstand the lease break hit, with the bonus coming soon. I do agree breaking a lease or flipping a car ever year is prob not a smart idea. In my economics 101 class they did not go over this as it's more common knowledge but happy to hear your Eco 101 recap at anytime."
4824,flightnurse,November 2011,"I had a co-worker do this in the last gas crunch, she traded in a big SUV, payments of $499/m for a toyota Prius, new payments $599/m her commute is all freeway, so she get better gas mileage, however she isn't saving that $100 difference because of her driving habit, she doesn't drive 65, more like 80... So she isn't getting the mileage she should. After 2 years she finally realized she made a big mistake.... BTW, insurance cost on hybrids are higher then that of non-hybrids."
4825,billyperksii,November 2011,"How much advance is the 2012 from the 2011? Secondly, let me reiterate for the 100th time- my car is on finance, do you want me to scan the contract on Edmunds? I have never heard of anyone leasing for five years, either that person is financially incapable or just bluntly speaking, an imbecile. When I mentioned in my post (many moons ago) about my next purchase, I meant the distant future, not immediately. Lastly, please stop talking about my bonus, just let it go or if you need one, spend less time on Edmunds and try to improve your financial modelling skills- that way you can properly cover your sector/companies and make your company some money."
4826,flightnurse,November 2011,"Mark you posting is right on, shoppers have short memory and most people shop for price and that is it. I would have to say, that the people who post on these forum make up less then 10% of buyers who really understand the brand and the cars. But you have ignore the fact that the Acrua RL has been a disaster for Acrua from day one. For $56K there are better cars out there people to chose from.  For me the TSX is a great car, however it needs a new engine, take the engine from the RDX and detune it to about 220hp and have it run on regular gas, this would transform the TSX in the car Arcua needs.  If Acrua is going to follow other companies, then the TL needs a turbo I4, if BMW can do it, so can Arcua, at the current RDX turbo and add some HP to it."

4828,flightnurse,November 2011,"Bill, its not worth the trouble trying to get sweeny to understand what you are posting, he makes it a habit of trying to make the other person look like a fool.  In Sweeny's world it is OK to place 4K down on a lease to get that uber low lease payment.... So maybe you should teach him car econ 101... Leases are not for everybody they work well if you can AFFORD the car, and I don't mean the payments, however sweeny doesn't think so...  Wow talk about two different cars the E65 and E550, either one is a nice ride."
4829,Kirstie_H,November 2011,"(Just replying to the most recent message... this post is for ALL):  Let's tone down the personal comments and the hostility. Really, the best course of action for posts or members that you don't care for is to just SKIP them and/or avoid responding."

4832,sweendogy,November 2011,"Again nurse I never mentioned anything about specific lease downpayments. I would defer to you on leasing as it seems you are the BMW leasing expert and I'm sure you got great deals on the 328 and the 535 you speak of. The 4k thing was never uttered by me- as I have told you in past posts - remember the ones you rebutted as ""leader ads"" when I told you they were posted on the company websites.  The fool comment is pretty funny- I think with each post you prove that point on your own.  On the afford comment - its an interesting debate - if you take financing and leasing out of the market place (obv this is not the case) how many people can actually afford in straight cash terms these autos.? Finance rates and used car values really make these cars available to the masses.  Billy market closed up 4% today."
4833,flightnurse,November 2011,"Hey Fed, some people make car payments and come people do not. I have to say, our next purchase will have a payment behind it but not a very big one, should have it paid off in a year and half... Not bad for a 60K car..."
4834,flightnurse,November 2011,"Sweeny you have stated that I could have had a 335i for extra $10-20/m if I leased the car, since you assumed I leased it. You kept posting the ""Lease specials"" from Infiniti however it takes $4K out of pocket to get those lease specials, that is not smart buying... Use someone else's money to lease a car and take that $4K and use it for something else.. Lie maybe the stock market..  BTW, you asked how do people pay cash for cars... Three ways, they saved up to pay cash, second, made a killing in the stock market or third mommy and or daddy gave them the money.  For me it was #1 and #2. When I got out of college, I kept the car I had, a 65 Mustang coupe for about 10 yrs post graduation, at that time I would place $300/m in a savings account, Then bought Harley stock before the stock split (doubled my money) then split again (double it again) and finally split again (doubled it again.)  I was able to buy my first BMW cash, and a house in San Diego (this was before the big boom in housing prices) Since then done very well in the stock market and flipping houses (stopped flipping houses for now.) People can buy cars for cash, but there are sacrifices one needs to make to do it. So my 2011 BMW was bought cash as well as the 2005. I take what the money payment would be and stick it in the bank so in 6 years I'll have enough to pay cash for the next one.  This is how people pay cash for cars.  BTW, the stock market has been very good to flightnurse the past 2 days, got to love when an airline files Chp 11..."
4835,sweendogy,November 2011,Nice story- wow - I'm out
4836,Kirstie_H,December 2011,"Not everyone can afford to pay cash for each vehicle. However, the key, as in all financial decisions, is to manage your debt. My goal has been to never be upside-down in a vehicle regarding value:debt ratio. Why does the amount have to get bigger?  I financed my last car for 5 years (due to unknown future financial circumstances) and paid it off in 4. When that was done, I had a nice downpayment that I chose to use to pay for an entire vehicle in cash. My SO, on the otherhand, has a vehicle he financed for 5 years, almost 4 years into it and it's almost paid off and he intends to keep it. If you're not upside-down and don't have visions of getting the most you can possibly afford, financing is a reasonable solution to not having the full whack.  (Stock market was nice to me too, especially Ford, which our stock club bought for something like $4 and sold a few months later for $7)"
4837,sweendogy,December 2011,"Interesting - what if finance rates were 10% ? Would you have financed or looked for a lesser car?  I agree smart thinking needs to go into taking down a material purchase - and given the current environment of higher used car values and lower bank rates are getting people into cars they would not normally afford. Maybe there is more to this... Thoughts  Btw new car sale numbers very strong for the Americans, Germans, toyo an Nissan. Honda still struggling with the flooding problems."
4838,Kirstie_H,December 2011,"A lesser car. No one NEEDS a fantastic car. I chose to do that this time around and purchased a ""lesser car"" in lieu of financing, so that I could pay cash. Last time I didn't have quite enough cash for a ""lesser car,"" plus I was driving a WHOLE lot at that point in time. Now I'm not. It was worth it back then to finance, and it didn't come close to stretching my budget."
4839,flightnurse,December 2011,"What do you mean if rates were 10%, they are for many people. When you see those ""special"" rates from manufactures they are for ""well qualified"" buyers. Which is terms mean credit score greater then 700.  When it comes to keeping up with the Jones, people will pay to say in the car that makes them feel good... It might not be the top of the line model though."
4840,nyccarguy,December 2011,"My thoughts on my 2010 TSX sort of echo some of your feelings toward your TL SH-AWD. The engine/transmission combination is very smooth. They feel perfectly matched together. I don't oogle over the styling of my TSX like say a 335i w/ M Sport Package, but its design is handsome & far from boring.  Could my TSX use more power via DI, FSI, Turbo, or Supercharging? Yes, but then how much torque could the front wheels handle? Would Acura's SH-AWD add too much as far as weight (& price) to its current entry level price tag without stealing sales from the base FWD TL?  I'm happy with my TSX."
4841,markcincinnati,December 2011,"The TL should only be sold in AWD trim, IMHO. According to my Ohio dealers, most of the TL's sold are Tech SH-AWD's anyway. I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period.  Content and price them with options and packages that make sense, but don't push massive amounts of technology in one package. In other words, offer a basic version of the cars (but ONLY in AWD trim.)  SH-AWD is damn near magic, it totally transforms the basic FWD car into a really believable ELLPS car. My dealers claim they sell mostly MDX's anyway, so Acura already seems to have at least the possibility of being all AWD all the time like Audi.  With the FWD models clouding the message, it seems Acura's sometimes are more like VW's than Audis, yet Acura has essentially stated it wants to be in the Premium class and that it wants to model itself on Audi.  I assume this makes sense since VW begat Audi and Honda begat Acura. Audi morphed (in the us) to the ""quattro"" company and claims to be the reigning champeen of AWD cars (with the most history, don't you know?) Audi has essentially eschewed FWD cars (in North America) in favor of AWD cars in order to be taken seriously as a contender in the Premium class -- where only RWD and AWD are taken seriously, it's in all the papers.  Acura keeps hanging on to its Honda roots where it's good AND where it's not so good, premium perception-wise. Audi, morphed from FWD to FWD and/or AWD to AWD, period. They entered and won contests and races and Wards awards and other awards, but these awards and the spoils of winning were all accomplished with their AWD versions. Although I guess you could buy an FWD A4 or A6, I don't know where you go to actually find one in the flesh for sale at a dealer.  And Audi did wonder ""how much power can one put throught the front wheels"" -- its answer was ""not enough, so we need to put MORE power through the front AND rear wheels."" And they are where they are now by taking the risk of virtually dropping FWD from the NA market.  And what happened next? BMW brought out the 325 (in 1988 (?) as I recall, since I had one) with AWD; then Mercedes started offering AWD here and there. Acura, Infiniti, Lexus, Volvo, VW, Cadillac, Buick and, and, and, the list goes on to cover every LPS and LPS wannabe brand and product.  As to the price impact -- I think it would be pretty easy to keep the price of an all SH-AWD fleet at about the current FWD models + $1,500; for the safety and performance this would offer, to say nothing of an image enhancement similar to that which Audi enjoyed, it is probably not a show stopper for the company.  And, most of us shopping in this class will probably not reject a new Acura that is exclusively offered with SH-AWD. For most, it ought to be a no-brainer.  I have nothing against FWD, btw, I just think it would be very helpful to Acura if it has the goal of remaining a serious premium class brand, to completely ditch any and all FWD offerings from its lineup.  :surprise:"
4842,shipo,December 2011,"Funny thing, for my current needs, wants and desires, the ""perfect"" car for me right-now-today would be an Audi A3 RWD (sacrilege I know, but I want it none-the-less) with a hotted up 2.0T and a 6-Speed manual. Of course no such a critter will ever exist, but one can dream can't one. :blush:"
4843,dino001,December 2011,I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period.  That's not entirely accurate. A3s and A4s are sold here mostly in FWD (Tampa). I asked a salesguy about it once. He surprised me. To Audi without AWD is like nonalcoholic beer or worse.
4844,sweendogy,December 2011,"While I agree Acura should ""advance"" I feel they do not need to completely change to awd. They did very well in the 90 and 2000s with a front wheel drive setup. The biggest mistake is they lost its passion and have made the car more Buick then BMW. The dropped the low cost integra that got the youth in the door. They made the tsx bloated and its best car the TL (legend) is ugly and bloated. They also killed the nsx which was a reason to go into the dealership in the first place. Fwd setup not great for performance but it was these thigs that killed the brand and it's sales numbers. - Sh-awd or whatever it's called is pretty good setup but it's not the answer to get people in the door- they have more cara in th lineup then they did 10 years ago and sell half the number of cars."

4846,nyccarguy,December 2011,"I think that's an excellent idea. Definitely a great way to differentiate Acura from its Honda roots. Buyers here in the northeast & new England will buy anything and everything AWD.  Give my TSX a turbo, SH AWD, & excellent brakes (the oem brakes are pathetic) & I'd give it another look."
4847,markcincinnati,December 2011,"If my message somehow went too far, I apologize -- I do not believe that moving to an all AWD line-up (or 99%, as in the case of Audi -- and in the case of Audi it is 100% of their advertising) will alone re-position Acura in the minds of the intended customers.  As I mentioned in my earlier post, the crux of the issue is not how these cars drive (if the 2012 TL Advance SH-AWD is any indicator), they are not a boring drive, not an incompetent drive, nor lacking in performance. The thing is the cars are pretty much not very attractive -- even if they do get bonus points for trying to look different.  They have the driving thing in pretty good shape as far as I'm concerned -- they need to modernize the engines and look at the content that is offered by every car brand/product they wish to emulate and be guided accordingly.  They need to consider making themselves perceived solely as an AWD company and they need an across the board styling transplant or upgrade asap.  Probably more than any other step they could take, styling is the one that will bear the most fruit. For, no matter how much they up their game in the performance or content arena, people need something to draw them to the showroom and something to feel good about after they buy.  My '12 TL is ""better"" in so many ways than my '09 A4 -- which was the first year for the change to the B8 platform for Audi. I would not expect this to remain thus -- a refreshed A4, most likely, will again be more attractive (in all the above ways) than the current TL (from a design perspective mainly.)  You don't have to agree with the magazines, but the current A6, which looks very much like a larger B8, A4, is winning friends, awards wise. No Acura is on any list I can find. BMW, too, remains a repeat top choice amongst those who award wins for being great.  Acura simply needs a style-ectomy, soon.  :sick:"
4848,sweendogy,December 2011,"Style I agree - I also think they need to go cheaper to find youth buyers. We have heard from owners that the TSX is a great value - but it's still 30k an bulk of the buyers are older people- make a 25k coupe with a power 4 that gets youth in the door. All in you can't pick a car under the Acura nameplate that says look at me - ""I'm rediculously good looking"" - and that's a major problem.  Love the traction this is finally getting - its time to release the TsX from this Elpps chat once and all as a lesson to Acura you can't stand around for 10 years and do nothing in an evolving car biz. (sorry for typos, iPhone)"
4849,nyccarguy,December 2011,"Sween - I agree with you & Mark that the Acura lineup definitely needs a makeover. You are right that none of the models scream ""I gotta have it.""  Like I said, my TSX is handsome (IMHO) but its styling doesn't compare to BMW, Audi, MB.  Practicality, Luxury, & Technology are driving people into Acura showrooms rather than style & performance."
4850,markcincinnati,December 2011,"Isn't the upcoming RSX supposed to come in at a lower price point? Of course then there's the issue that the TSX is supposedly a cancelled product and that the TL will shrink in size.  But if you can at least suggest that you can offer a lower entry point, price-wise, you may find you attract more and younger customers. Truth be told the TL is actually much bigger feeling than my outgoing A4, which did, technically, have a longer wheel-base, but the TL is wider.  Again, we seem to be in violent agreement, Acura needs an overall styling cue that is spread across all cars and, first and foremost, is attractive.  You may or may not like the look of an Audi, but the entire line from the lowest cost A3 to the big buck A8L or R8 all have cues that they are Audi's.  BMW, ditto.  Acura is trying with their beak front end, but it obviously wasn't working for them, considering the plastic surgery the TL just underwent.  C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points!"
4851,ivan_99,December 2011,C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points!  ...any KIA (Rio starting at 13k).  To me it seemed like the Acura beak was trying to imitate the Cadillac shield...but it ended up looking to thick and plasticky...
4852,nyccarguy,December 2011,I don't know how much lower the price of an entry level Acura can go. I think the average new car price is $30K. The $30K price point is the new $20K price point of 15 years ago.
4853,dino001,December 2011,"They should have never ditched RSX. That would have been a great $25K+ entry with $28K-30K Type S. Small overlap with top of Civic with extra zip (make base engine 10 hp stronger) and equipment.  Honda must be experiencing some big internal struggles that we don't know about. Just look at latest Civic and Accord. The ""sportyish"" DNA is all but gone, virtually no trace.  I recently a rented Accord (yes, I was surpirised myself - Hertz had Accord in their rental fleet). Mechanicals were adequate, but the car did not impress me at all. Really cheap interior, barge look, even some ergonomics were not so great (always strong suit of Japanese cars). Long story short, if I were in market for family midsize sedan, Accord may not even make the short list."
4854,sweendogy,December 2011,"Mark- I have no details on the new Rsx- which as am ex integra gs-r owner I had no interest in- car was not that excitingly all- the integra had the ns-x to look up to plus my gs-r was close to the type r that was very rare and wanted by anyone under 28 years old.  NYCcarguy- the death of the Rsx and the no entry point at mid 20ks is a problem- the 4 door current TSx is boring - no other term to use- its a nice safe play but 95% are auto an 97% come with the 4 that is taxed in its current form.  They have alot of holes, no supercar, no coupe, no convert, Zdx, a turbo 4 that gets terrible Mpgs, ugly Tl, tsx thats bloated, Zdx and the fact that it's current line does not have one car people have to own (see sonata). Yes I mentioned the Zdx 2 times- it seats 4, weights more then the mdx, ugly and has the sr engine as then mdx- also its overpriced .  Acura is the new Buick. Buick is the new startup. Acura has 2 choices given recent sales numbers - die or redue. Acura has a choice to make - let's hope they choose wisely."
4855,tlong,December 2011,"They have alot of holes, no supercar, no coupe, no convert, Zdx, a turbo 4 that gets terrible Mpgs, ugly Tl, tsx thats bloated, Zdx and the fact that it's current line does not have one car people have to own (see sonata). Yes I mentioned the Zdx 2 times- it seats 4, weights more then the mdx, ugly and has the sr engine as then mdx- also its overpriced .  Interesting points. When I bought my TL in '04, the TL was among the best looking sedans out there, they had the tight, nimble, and pretty good looking TSX, they had the RSX, they had the original better looking MDX. Then they bloated and uglied up the whole line, and dropped the RSX. A bunch of steps backwards. No wonder they are slipping in sales. Honda has really lost its way."
4856,sweendogy,December 2011,"Yep - I think both last generation tl and tsx were good cars- they looked the part - didnt dare challenge, because Acura was smart and didn't include them in the conversation with real lux sports cars. They both were very well prices to the lower end and again both looked great.  I feel when the last Acura name died (integra) I think the brand was slowly doing soon there after"
4857,nyccarguy,December 2011,"Your ideal vehicle sweendoggy?  The result is a BRZ that came in under its target weight at 2,690 pounds according to Subaru. That's about 100 pounds less than a Honda Civic Si, and it feels like it, too."
4858,sweendogy,December 2011,Never saw that thing before- 24-25k coupe hat has some go- that's what the next rsx or integra should be - nice post.
4859,m6user,December 2011,Scion will market the same thing in US and Toyota will market the same in Japan. All three have 200hp and not a lot of torque until screaming. Subaru did engine...Toyota most of the rest. Not entry level luxury but entry level sports.
4860,flightnurse,December 2011,Are you saying that BMW is being a 2 liter diesel? 320d???
4861,flightnurse,December 2011,"Interesting to hear that, however if you lived here why would you drive 80 miles RT? would you live in Casa Grande?"
4862,shipo,December 2011,"""Are you saying that BMW is being a 2 liter diesel? 320d???""  Yes, that is my understanding; there are supposedly two different 2.0 liter diesel 320d versions being released to the market, one a higher mileage version and one a higher power version. That said, it remains to be seen if both will make it here to the States."
4863,sweendogy,December 2011,"Good question would love to see a manual awd version - one can dream.  Internal thought ""Infiniti can you build a manual g37xs before manuals go the way of the north American redtailed puffin"""
4864,flightnurse,December 2011,"Shipo that is good news, with the way today's diesels run this should be a great combo, just hopefully BMW wont price it too high."
4865,nyccarguy,December 2011,"That was my main problem with the E90 335d. They tried to go upmarket with it thinking maybe people would buy a 335d over a 335i. Hopefully a small diesel will be offered price comparable to the 328i. Oh, & please offer diesel with a stick & Xdrive."

4871,nyccarguy,December 2011,"Looks like its getting WORSE! This ISX is a guided up Civic. The next RDX is just a V6 powered CRV, no SH-AWD, no 4 cyl turbo?"
4872,sweendogy,December 2011,Rut row.  Guess they are not reading this blog - we should remove the tsx as penalty- lets add a Buick - hosts ...hello
4873,markcincinnati,December 2011,"New Acura line up: 3 cars, 2 CUV's 1 Super car.  SMALL - ISX - a deluxe Civic (no SH-AWD apparently). MEDIUM - TL - (maybe, MAYBE renamed) can't tell if it will remain this size or shrink or grow LARGE - RL or maybe LEGEND (as large, interior that is, as a BMW 7 series)  RDX - based on CR-V, (no SH-AWD apparently). MDX - redesigned and will hit the market in calendar 2013 (as a '14?)  NSX - one V6 (direct injection) 2 electric motors (for the rear)  The cars will not stress performance and apprently Acura owners #5 most desired content is the sound system (does that mean the ELS system will go away?)  Hard to tell exactly what NOT stressing performance means -- keep the current 305HP offering and make it get better MPG's? Tune the suspensions for comfort rather than handling prowess?  The Acura statement says something about getting away from Honda -- yet two of the 5 cars will be tarted up Hondas (which may be a good thing since the price will, apparently, be low -- but no SH-AWD?) Bummer.  Well, I think the performance of the '12 TL 3.7 SH-AWD Advance is very Audi-like -- will Acura hold the line and NOT improve this, or will the new TL (whatever it may be called) be tuned for a more Buick like ride and not be granted direct injection or a turbo or super-charger (option).  Stating that you WANT to be the best second tier car you can be seems akin to (almost) throwing in the towel.  My wife, lusting for an MDX to replace her FX35 (for the SH-AWD) is rethinking this now.  I am wondering if my '12 is my first and last Acura?  32 months to go."
4874,sweendogy,December 2011,32 months to go - well atleast it's no a pre-2012 with the ugly beak.
4875,markcincinnati,December 2011,"It's only a little bit beaky looking -- but I got it because it performed very well, was comfortable, had a great sound system and seemed like the most bang for the buck amongst my choices.  I do enjoy driving it, which was one of the ""must have's"" for me, too.  Reputation for reliability and durability didn't hurt any either."
4876,nyccarguy,December 2011,I am wondering if my '12 is my first and last Acura?  Mark - I wonder the same thing about my 2010 TSX. I just refinanced it again as I plan to pay it off & keep it for a while. Somebody else is going to have to make one HELLUVA car to make me not buy a BMW next.  Original Loan from dealer was 5.65% for 60 months. Refinanced after 1 yr @ 3.44% FOR 48 months. Refinanced again after 2 yrs @ 2.41% for 36 months.
4877,sweendogy,December 2011,Look if your happy with the car and it's not a burden in costs then run it. Those cars a bullets compared to others in the group. It's a euro accord - Honda standard of good reliability. The brand is failing to excite but it's still a Honda and if your refinancing continues you will be at zero % in 2 more rounds.
4878,nyccarguy,December 2011,"That's probably the last of refinancing the TSX. Hopefully I'll be able to pay it off in 2 more years, then start doubling up on my Pilot payments to get that Paid off sooner than its original 5 year loan."

4883,sweendogy,December 2011,Good service as well
4884,fedlawman,December 2011,"It's been a little while since I've driven a Golf, but if memory serves, it was a lot more refined than a Civic.  Bank vault solid with well damped NVH - light years beyond the Civic."
4885,fkong,December 2011,"I recently leased an IS350 F-Sport. Before making this decision, I also looked at a few other cars, and will let you guys know why I went with the big L. Even my brother was excited that I got the IS350, versus any of the other cars.  Acura TL - I did consider this car. I actually do find the car to be quite attractive. But, I find that it's a bit huge. Plus, why this car isn't RWD is a whole new story, and I don't want AWD. I can accept the front beak problem.  Audi A4 - Audi's never really appealed to me. Don't get me wrong, they're nice. My brother has an A6 that I do find some beauty in, but they just aren't my cup of tea. And, same situation with the Acura, why isn't it RWD?  BMW 3-series - Cost more than my IS350 F-Sport to begin with (almost $47k for the 328i w/ M-Sport package, Nav, auto, parking sensors) versus my car (F-Sport package, Nav, Backup camera, auto, NO parking sensors). Chances are, if I want the 335, it'll be more than $50k. Plus, I don't want to look like every other guy on the street. I'm in So Cal, and the 3-series are more popular than Camry's here.  Cadillac CTS - I wanted to buy American, but America's definition of luxury involves the use of low end materials. I do like the car, though.  Infiniti G37 - If I were to get the Infiniti G, it would be the coupe (I had a G35 coupe a few years ago and love it). Therefore, I won't be getting a ELLPS. I find the G sedan to be absolutely ugly, plus the fact that it's so big. At least it's RWD.  Mercedes C-class - I do like the way the C-class looks, but the C250, after configuring, costs as much as my IS350. I do believe that Mercedes finally decided they wanted a piece of the ELLPS pie, and seriously upped the ante with the C-class. The previous 2 generations of C-class were, IN MY OPINION, bad jokes gone wrong. BMW, at least, had the right formula with the 3-series.  With these points, I decided to go with the IS350, and absolutely love it. Perhaps when the lease is up, I might step up to the new 2013 GS."
4886,shipo,December 2011,"Agreed on the Civic versus Golf thing. Three years ago I needed a new inexpensive commuter car and after test driving both cars (in addition to the Corolla, the Focus, and the Mazda3) I had settled on a Golf (called a Rabbit back then); the Civic simply wasn't in the same league. Unfortunately due to the Mark V to Mark VI model change-over, all of the Rabbits with manual transmissions had pretty much been sold and the only cars left were automatics; I ended up with a Mazda3 instead.  Fast forward to this year, my wife was looking for a new car, and while we didn't drive a Golf per-se, we did drive a GTI, and once again I was impressed with the vault like feeling of the car; after thirteen and a half years of driving exclusively minivans, my wife now has a new 2-Door black GTI 6-Speed sitting in her garage bay. Can't wipe the silly grin off of her face."
4887,sweendogy,December 2011,"Love the way the IS 350 looks- but again it's auto only,has been around for a bunch of years and has had minimal updates. The is f package is pretty cool looking but adds significant price and options on this car add up quickly as well. I sat in a 2011 IS 350 awd and it's sticker was almost 50k. Your right not many people ride the IS 350 but up north we do see alot of 250 Awds- so I don't know how exclusive the car may be where you live. Performance wise I know it's quick but have not seen many articles written to understand the full merit of its capabilities. The new GS is something that interests me - wonder which direction Lexus goes-  Enjoy the ride"
4888,dino001,December 2011,"It may just be, but again - you have to compare with base version, i.e. starting point. Golfs sold in Europe are good to understand how much any line can be refined."
4889,billyperksii,December 2011,"Sween , are the new GS on dealers lot? If, yes, I will probably pass by and take a look, the pictures I saw online did not impress me."
4890,fkong,December 2011,"Depending on your location. Where I'm at (So Cal), Longo Lexus claims they're going to get it by early 2012."
4891,fedlawman,December 2011,"""you have to compare with base version, i.e. starting point. Golfs sold in Europe are good to understand how much any line can be refined.""  The trim version has nothing to do with what I'm talking about."

4893,nyccarguy,December 2011,"So my driving a TSX V6 (no tech pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our board's Acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. The TSX V6 has got some guts to it. I don't think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. I do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.  Acura's lineup right now has too much overlapping. There is a mere $885 difference between the TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg (a small percentage of TSX sales) & a TL w/ Tech Pkg (FWD). The difference between a TL (FWD, No Tech Pkg) & a TSX (4cyl) w/ Tech Pkg is $2695.  Sween & Mark have both made some excellent points regarding the TSX, the TL, & the future of Acura.  Here's what I have to say:  Acura wants to be a sport/luxury division of Honda. The TSX is a good entry level starting point. Ditch the 4cyl & make the TSX V6 the base model. Acura constantly offers $4000 incentives on the V6 model anyway, so just make that the base engine. Offset the nose heaviness with Acura's SH AWD.  Now this is easy for me to say. It does have some problems though. The TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. Add another 241 lbs for Acura's SH AWD system. You've got a grand total of 3921 lbs. That's a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base TSX is too heavy.  The other problem about making SH AWD available on the TSX is its cost. $3550 per car is what Acura charges now on a TL.  I really do LOVE Mark's idea of making SH AWD standard across the line.  More on this later."
4894,tlong,December 2011,I just can't see going 6cyl on the entry car as making any sense. It destroys the handling and further bloats up an already bloated TSX relative to the original. And even BMW is going 4cyl. Just seems like a bigger bloated entry boat of a car isn't the way to go.
4895,nyccarguy,December 2011,Acura doesn't have a weight trimming budget like BMW does. You are also forgetting that the enthusiast community as a whole makes up such a small percentage of the car buying public.  Did I notice the extra 200 lbs in the nose of my V6 TSX loaner? Yes. Would the average ELLPS buyer? No.  Would the average ELLPS buyer notice the difference between the 2.4L 4cyl & the 3.5L V6 for the same price? Yes.  Do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider AWD a luxury feature? Yes. Do they pay a price premium for it? Yes. Do they care that AWD adds weight? No.
4896,nyccarguy,December 2011,"There's also a big difference between BMW's new blown 4 w/ an 8 speed auto and Acura's NA 4 cyl hooked up to a 5 speed automatic.  Most BMW buyers won't know their new ""Bimmer"" has a 4 cyl engine unless the salesman tells them."
4897,tlong,December 2011,"Do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider AWD a luxury feature? Yes. Do they pay a price premium for it? Yes. Do they care that AWD adds weight? No.  I understand the needs for AWD in certain climates.  Acura was successful for a long time with the Integra and Legend. Then it was the TSX and TL. And now it is the fat TSX and fat TL and useless RL. The fuel economy regulations are getting tougher and tougher. BMW is going 4 cyl in the US on smaller cars. BMW and Infiniti sell a LOT of cars based upon sporty handling, which is something that Acura has lost much of in the TSX. Adding a fuel hogging 6 cyl, then throwing 200 lbs. of AWD for the *entire market* seems like the wrong direction to me for an ELLPS.  Acura must decide what it wants to be.  A luxury Subaru? - then perhaps your suggestion makes sense. A cheaper Lexus? - keep numbing them up and improve dealer service even more. A bargain BMW? - Sorry, they were more in that camp before the latest refreshes."
4898,m6user,December 2011,You place a lot of importance on having RWD yet you chose a car with a slushbox? I don't get it  Ask the approx 85% of BMW owners that drive automatics the same question. People can enjoy RWD with either transmission. It may be more fun to row your own for many people but not a neccesitiy to enjoy the car.
4899,nyccarguy,December 2011,"Market the AWD for winter needs in the snowy climates & as a performance advantage in the areas where the weather is nice.  TSX 4cyl Automatic - 22 city / 31 highway TSX 6cyl Automatic - 18 city / 28 highway  Driving my 4cyl & the dealer's 6cyl back to back gave me a good perspective on the strengths & weaknesses of each.  Steering - One thing I truly dislike about my 2010 TSX 4 cyl is the lifeless electric power steering. It transmits no road feel at low speeds and artificially firms up at higher speeds.  The 6 cyl is equipped with hydraulic power steering. While a little over boosted for my tastes, it is progressively linear and very smooth. I totally prefer this setup to the electric unit in my 4 cyl.  The V6 has an obvious edge in the acceleration department. Jump on the accelerator and it keeps going. I was traveling at triple digit speeds this AM berore I backed off and returned to a much more sedate 70. Passing is never a problem.  My 4 cyl's acceleration is adequate. It never feels strained. I also know how to use the engine's high RPM power band. Merging onto the highway and cruising at 80 - 90 mph aren't a problem. I have to admit that getting back into my car tonight I was disappointed after driving it's V6 cousin for a day.  Both cars ride nicely without feeling isolated.  The handling edge goes to my 4 cyl TSX hands down. While far from a dedicated RWD chassis, the TSX makes the most of its Accord platform roots. There is a lightness to it. You can feel the weight transfer going around curves.  The V6 is 200 lbs heavier & you feel the boat anchor during spirited driving. The VSA (skid control) is constantly fighting with this giant weight over the front wheels.  The TSX is definitely (IMO) a luxury, performance oriented vehicle. Having driven both the E90 BMW 3 series (in both 328 & 335 flavors) as well as the Infiniti G37X, I think there's NO argument from anybody they are the true driver's cars of the group.  I've read up and am impressed by the new Mercedes-Benz C-class reviews, but will reserve judgement until I actually get behind the wheel of one.  I think even though it is FWD, the TSX stacks up against an Audi A4 2.0T (not the $50,000 prestige with Audi's Sport Differential).  I've told you guys before, I originally bought the TSX for my wife using a cash for clunkers credit. I inherited it from her when we decided to buy a Pilot in anticipation of our 3rd child (Whitney is 3 weeks old today).  Would I have bought it for myself if I went out car shopping for my daily driver that didn't have fuel economy restrictions? It wouldn't have been my 1st choice, I'll readily admit.  Driving Dynamic wise, I'd pick the E90 3 then the G37XS sedan, & a distant 3rd would be the TSX.  I'm happy with my TSX."
4900,nyccarguy,December 2011,Whoops! I knew that. My bad. Thanks for the correction.
4901,sweendogy,December 2011,"your opinion is fine and I guess you are not the target audience for the car-Reviewers and sales numbers support the public likes what they are doing.  1) yep HP is something that advances if MPG stay the same or get better - CHECK- 2) COUPE - yep thats something that others have - convertables as well- but some car companies do not play in these areas- they have a hard top convert as wel- 3)transmissions - car companies do have issues with them for sure- remember the 03 TL and others 4) more then you write is included including paddles - they also offered rear wheel steering on earlier models 5) you forgot to mention the sports line they released, sure its on a small number of cars but its something  currently, you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology, the performance and the value in the brand."
4902,kdshapiro,December 2011,"Ya, know I feel the same about the TL, nothing to draw me into showroom. No disrepect for any TL owners.  The G does have sedan, coupe, convertible and IPL. Yes the seven speed is reported to give some trouble, I don't have trouble with mine. If I remember, Honda went through a set of issues of it's own related to the tranny.  The M model has hybrid solution, hope it trickles down to the G."
4903,billyperksii,December 2011,"""currently, you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology, the performance and the value in the brand."" No I don't, sorry. Please let us know the appreciating value in owning a G35 or any Infinit product or just plain simple any brand of car."
4904,billyperksii,December 2011,"The M model has hybrid solution, hope it trickles down to the G."" So does this the Civic and the Accord."
4905,markcincinnati,December 2011,"After 11 months with an Infiniti product, I have become a believer that they are producing cars that do warrant consideration especially if your other choice is a BMW. Of course, this Great Recession may be partially the cause of my ""conversion."" Despite the fact that I find the G too small (narrow), I believe it to be a bargain when compared to a 3 series. Max one of the G37X's out and it is, perhaps, $45K. Content the 3 as close as possible to the G and the price will be a lot higher.  BMW's are breathtakingly expensive to repair (and sometimes even maintain) after the 50,000 mile BMW bubble expires. The Infiniti we own -- FX35 -- seems to be pretty inexpensive to maintain, and the 7 speed transmission has been trouble free (and we are now at about 18K miles).  Everyone here is certainly entitled to not find anything attractive about a given brand or model within the brand -- and that is fine. However, if you have not recently taken an Infiniti (or any other car listed here on the masthead) out for a long test-drive, it seems unlikely that you can make a factual statement about the brand or specific model.  I know, for instance, that I have not driven a Lexus -- my opinion is that they are sofa's on wheels -- but that is only based on car magazine comments that I have read. I probably have my head up my nose in thinking that they are not ""performance"" cars. I plan to not opine any further on the brand since I know very little about them.  I really don't care if anyone test drives an Infiniti or an Acura -- I do care, somewhat, if a specific model is criticized but never driven. I participate in these boards to learn and to share experiences and opinions.  I do enjoy being regaled by owners' (or even car mavens who have tested so many cars it almost seems a career) stories about their experiences.  Keep 'em coming!  And. . .drive it like you live.  :shades:"
4906,sweendogy,December 2011,Like the above statement - I still don't understand your argument but I respect your opinion. Net net agrument weak opinion strong.
4907,kdshapiro,December 2011,The Civic or Accord does not put out 350 horsepower nor are they luxury vehicles.
4908,kdshapiro,December 2011,"There are some cases where serendipity happens and being an opinionated poseur is being 100% correct.  Lexus' , at least some models, are sofas on wheels. I took an ES350 on two extended test drives. There obviously is a market for them as there are quite a few on the road. They are nice cars, beautifully crafted, reliabile and a ton of tech.  I, however, wanted more toward sporty aspirations. TL was too big, turning radius too big, not convinced of the value of SHAWD. G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. I didn't even want to look at the TL 2012.  As you aptly put it, outfit a 335 like a G37 and you are at $50 large.  To each their own, everybody has their own priorities of what they want and/or dislike in a vehicle."
4909,nyccarguy,December 2011,"OK guys, we've been doing a lot of bickering disagreeing on the board lately. Let's try something different. If you've got any kind of driving experience (whether via test drive or ownership) with one of the ELLPS cars share with the group. I'll go first. Go to the bathroom & set your DVR, this is going to be a decent sized post.  Acura TSX: As you all know, I own a 2010 Acura TSX with Technology Package. It's the 2.4 L 4 cylinder mated to a 5 - Speed Automatic transmission. I originally bought the car for my wife when we had 2 kids and were 2 years into leasing a 2007 BMW X3. After 2 years we already had 38,000 miles on it (and were only alloted 45,000 for 3 years). On the last day of cash for clunkers I bought the TSX using a $3500 credit.  I think the TSX is handsome. Not head turning gorgeous like a 911 Turbo or 458 Italia. I definitely don't think it's ugly.  I like the engine/transmission combination. The engine winds all the way up to 7000 RPM very smoothly. Transmission shifts are crisp. The transmission will hold a gear and not upshift at the redline. I love the thickly bolstered seats & the well crafted interior. It rides fantastic. Comfortable, yet far from isolated. Handling for a FWD car is very good.  My main gripes with the car are it's lifeless electric power steering and it's crummy, straight from an Accord brakes.  Infiniti G37X: My Uncle had one and he let me drive it. I took it on a really nice, 45 minute drive. I came away extremely impressed with this car. kdshapiro hit the nail right on the head when he said: G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. This car's 326 horsepower make it a bona fide road rocket. Handling is truly amazing. Excellent balance. I got in the car and found pefect seating right away. After 5 minutes, it felt like it was MINE. The car feels like it is turning on an axis. If it had gotten an EPA estimated 2 mpg more, I'd have one sitting in my drivewy right now. It didn't qualify for the $3500 C4C rebate though.  Lexus IS 350: I drove one at a Lexus event when this body style came out in 2006. I happen to like the car's styling. The interior was well crafted and well thought out. Acceleration was blazingly quick. I thought the suspension was too isolated, the brakes were instant on and had no pedal feel to them at all. The back seat was tiny too (this coming from a guy who drives a Prelude).  BMW E90 3 series: I have extensively driven an E90 328xiA & E90 335xiA. The 328xiA was my Mom's car that she leased for 3 years. Even the heaviest E90 sedan (AWD & Automatic) with the 240 hp NA I6 is a blast to drive. Handling was unbelieveable. The engine is so smooth. Brakes are fantastic. Very progressive and linear. I'm madly in love with this car. It is everything people rave about and more.  I had a 335xiA as a loaner a few times. It's torque is seductive. Pulls like a small V8 rather than a turbo 6. Amazing car.  My biggest gripes with the 3 series is its cramped back seat, small trunk, and hefty price. I know it is a BMW and you get what you pay for. flightnurse, you happened to find a ""perfect"" driver's car sitting on a lot and got a helluva deal on it. My Mom's was an '08 328xiA with premium, cold weather, automatic, metallic paint, parking sensors, & manual sunshades (no sport, nav, or comfort access). It stickered for over $46,000. It is very easy for a 335 to get in the $50K range.  Questions? Comments?"
4910,billyperksii,December 2011,"Mark, I dont just blabber about a car and read some article in a magazine. I actually test drove the G35X for an extensive time. The salesperson actually gave me the keys and said have fun but be careful. I wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 TL Type S, the G just did not do it for me, I tried to force myself to like it but I just knew it would have been buyers remorse. Here are the deal breakers and I have said this many a times- 1).Too cramp (mazda millennia interior size) 2). Intrusive growl (could get annoying a long road trips) 3). I just felt beat up after the test drive  I have nothing against the brand, maybe the next generation G will sway me but from what I seen with the new styling cues on the M, G coupe and FX-I think I will step on my accelerator when I go by an Infiniti dealership."
4911,sweendogy,December 2011,"Finally some substance. I agree the G could be a little cramped when compared to a TL or Buick- infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the cars seats are a problem. The growl is something that older folks have also complained about- the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the city. The 07 and 08s sedans for sure also make sounds - this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway- the newer g37 sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a cruiser and to accommodate the older folks who complained. As I type Im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which I'm dreading because we are not taking my g- we have to take my wifes cr-v because its roomier- the g is not a problem at all on long trips, I mean it's not a 89 covrvette - its a great highway cruiser when asked.  Styling is subjective so can't argue."
4912,nyccarguy,December 2011,"The original IS300 was a great 1st entry into this segment. Razor sharp handling & excellent brakes. It's 215 horsepower I6 was outgunned by the BMW E46 328i (and then by the 330i) and it got not so great fuel economy (and this is when gas was cheap). Lexus owners complained about the ""rough ride."". Lexus brought the car in to compete with BMW's E36, but the E46 was already on its way by the time the IS300 hit our shores. They brought brass knuckles to a gun fight.  They brought the 300 hp IS 350 (automatic only). Toyota Corporate V6. 0-60 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s. Brakes that provided excellent stopping distance, but with not much pedal feel. Lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs. 255 in BMW's recently released E90 330i.  I drove the Lexus IS350 back to back with a 330i at their event. The Lexus out accelerated the BMW, but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic BMW.  The IS250 had no power.  The problem with the IS350 was that only a year after its release was sent packing by BMW's N54 twin turbo 300 hp I6.  I think Lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next IS. They might just hit one out this time."
4913,billyperksii,December 2011,Sween-Good luck on your road trip and dont forget the Roadside Assistance number.
4914,kdshapiro,December 2011,"Nah, might only need it if one drives and Acura."
4915,sweendogy,December 2011,It's a Honda no roadside needed.
4916,tlong,December 2011,"I wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 TL Type S, the G just did not do it for me, I tried to force myself to like it but I just knew it would have been buyers remorse.  When I was looking for a new 2005 ELLPS, I looked at the G35 along with the TL. The G35 was noticeably a bit narrow, but not a show stopper for me. I actually like a bit smaller cars. I thought the TL's interior was nicer. I drove the G35 and noticed the major power, along with a major growl. I didn't like the lack of refinement. The TL was smooth and quiet.  I then drove the G35 on a transition ramp between two freeways that you can take at about 55mph. There is a perpendicular concrete seam with a bit of elevation difference on this ramp, so going over it, the car jolts a bit and it is on a fast curve. On the TL, the car was steady over the bump. On the G35, the steering wheel jerked pretty hard and I really had to be holding it tight or it would have jerked out of my hand. Not so on the TL. Based upon that experience, the TL won. I just turned 115K on my TL today, and I've only had to replace a window actuator along with normal maintenance and an outside air temp gauge recall. No other mechanical issues."
4917,kdshapiro,December 2011,Unless the tranny goes.
4918,sweendogy,December 2011,It's a 2011. We should be fine- but I do have roadside help if needed.
4919,dino001,December 2011,"Hahahahahahahaha  I just got 328i wagon with manual. Picked it up two month ago in Munich and again yesterday in Spartanburg, SC Performance Center. So, unless I'm in the Matrix-like dream world, I can vouch personally that they make a non-M manual transmission car, even in least ""cool"" body type. :P  All it takes is go to a dealer and order it (yeah, the may not have one on their lot, but it does exist)."
4920,ivan_99,December 2011,To me it doesn't matter how the engine sounds at wot  Why not?
4921,sweendogy,December 2011,The problem I have with this conversation is the fact that under no duress the engine is as quiet as any on the board. When bullying to 60 it's not going to sound like a a4 or a tsx or even a lexas es350. It's got a boatload more power then anyof these comps. I think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane -
4922,tlong,December 2011,"I think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane -  There ARE plenty of powerful engines that aren't harsh when under high acceleration. But the Infiniti ""G"" is not one of them."
4923,carnaught,December 2011,"Regarding the Infiniti's ""exhaust note"": I think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane  I for one, totally submitted to, and agreed with your statement but found that on a daily basis, it was too intrusive and I didn't enjoy the car and did not want to live with it. So, there are some of us who feel differently following the progression of the ownership experience. This doesn't mean that Infiniti doesn't give one a great car for the money."
4924,sweendogy,December 2011,"I think it's tough to get a feel of the cars sound during a test drive- I for one try to put the potential car thru a few tests around performance - don't know if you were doing this but I can tell you at highway speeds the car is quiet. Is it S class quiet, not even close. For me it's not intrusive at all- and I actaully like the sound it makes - sure it's more mustang then merc but you actually feel like you've got something special when you hammer the gas."
4925,sweendogy,December 2011,"Please name a more powerful engine in car that is listed for under 37 k has 4doors and is quieter? Move to the right, fast lane reserved.."
4926,rayainsw,December 2011,"'To me it doesn't matter how the engine sounds at wot.' I respect the viewpoint. To me, it matters - a lot. Part of the pleasure I derive from acceleration includes the sound and the smoothness of the internal combustion engine - conveying an impression that it is ""happy in it's work"". I do not want to hear \ feel an engine like the current Infiniti V6. - Ray Spends a lot of time at WOT..."
4927,carnaught,December 2011,"Part of the pleasure I derive from acceleration includes the sound and the smoothness of the internal combustion engine - conveying an impression that it is ""happy in it's work"".

4928,carnaught,December 2011,"I can tell you at highway speeds the car is quiet. Is it S class quiet, not even close.  I don't disagree but it is in city traffic, from stoplight to stoplight, where I especially have the problem with it. I had the car for a while and put quite a few city and highway miles on it."
4929,sweendogy,December 2011,"Ray and carnut - just turn up the oldies station you listen to and you will not hear a peep out of the ""loud"" struggling engine. 10k difference in price - think about all the rolling stones purchases on iTunes.  Well said"
4930,tlong,December 2011,"Please name a more powerful engine in car that is listed for under 37 k has 4doors and is quieter?  Gee, I said there are more powerful engines that don't growl so much, and now you're adding ""...listed under 37K....has four doors....and is quieter..."".  As if those have anything to do with the fact that the engine still growls and there are more refined engines out there. And quieter <> vibration, growl, harshness."
4931,cdnpinhead,December 2011,"Nissan products since 1965, and the car I enjoyed the most and drove the greatest distance was a '73 240Z. That car had a beautiful straight six that I'd put up against nearly anything today. We currently own a '04 Pathfinder with the 3.5 litre V6.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a truck engine -- we have a truck, and it's great. In a car, not so much. Something about the Viper V10 comes to mind.  Once a truck engine. . ."
4932,sweendogy,December 2011,"You never said more powerful either, why did you add that? So what are the cars that have more power but are mute ?"
4933,sweendogy,December 2011,You know BMW uses the same engine in there SUVs and sedans as well
4934,nyccarguy,December 2011,"As one of the younger (35) posters here, I dont think coarse engine noise would bother me. I've obviously heard many G37s take off and I do like their distinct exhaust note.  My TSX's engine is super smooth all the way up to its 7,000 RPM redline.  I have the best of both worlds in my Prelude equipped with an Apexi World Sport Exhaust. My Prelude sounds docile at idle, at low speeds, & while cruising on the highway. During on ramp merges & 5th to 3rd downshift passing when the tach needle sweeps past 5200 RPM, my Prelude roars all the way up to it's 7500 RPM redline. And I LOVE it!"
4935,kdshapiro,December 2011,"It just doesn't bother me at wot. What I want at wot is power, I don't care about the sound. Cruising down the highway at 65 is another matter. The G is as civilized as they come."
4936,kdshapiro,December 2011,"Ya' know, one man's driving like a granny (no offense to grandmothers) is another man's driving like a bat out of you know where. And vice-versa, they guy who things he is driving like a bat out of hello, is driving like a granny to another driver.  I spend half of my hourish commute going from stoplight to stoplight. There are days I turn off the radio just to listen to the engine growl. I absolutely love it. I get 22 average, with 29 on the highway cruising at 70. I cannot complain.  When I punch it (which is not very often), the thing just moves, I could care less about what the NVH is for the 10 seconds I have the petal to the metal.  To each their own.  When I test drove the es350, yep it was quiet, but it was clearly missing something that I was looking for in my next vehicle."
4937,kdshapiro,December 2011,"Well if you remove the computers, smog controls etc, it's amazing what you can do with a 1973 engine. Of course, one can't build those engines today and have them be street legal."
4938,tlong,December 2011,"You never said more powerful either, why did you add that? So what are the cars that have more power but are mute ?  You misquoted me. I said there are plenty of powerful engines out there that are not so harsh. Not ""more powerful"" - although I'm sure there are some of those, too. Audi, Acura, and BMW V6's are significantly less harsh. In fact, when I was looking at the G35 vs. Acura TL in 2005, it was the harshness of the G that turned me off, along with a substandard interior vs. its competitors."
4939,sweendogy,December 2011,"Reread your 12800 post again. Again you keep saying there may be more powerful engine that is quieter but have yet to name it. I will answer the question - the answer is non in this class. You have mentioned many times the harshness of the engine and compare it to the tl and others, ok we have heard thi before - how does the tl and Audi compare in performance when then engines in question are pushed? The 2005 TL and G have changed alot in 7 years- take another test drive and stay out of the left lane"
4940,sweendogy,January 2012,"Sounds like you found your next rig congrats. I also like the vw passat, after all it's car of the year . I would suggest you check out the turbo desil -Gets 700 miles per tank, but given your last posts the torque and potential sound coming from the engine might get you sideways. Does it come standard with 18's?"
4941,fedlawman,January 2012,"Unfortunately, 18"" wheels are standard. I would prefer the 17's, which are standard on the TDI. I've never driven a TDI, so I don't know if I would like it or not (the sound quality or power delivery).  Our Volvo is an I-5 and it's not the most refined motor either. My wife is the primary driver and she thinks it's fine, but I don't love it. The VR6 would be a little ($3500) indulgence for the rare occasions that I would drive it.  I also really prefer wood trim accents, but it's only offered on the top-level SEL. The SEL includes Navigation and real leather, which I don't want. Damn packages..."
4942,savetheland,January 2012,"Yeah, but Passat has absolutely boring looks. The reason we pay extra for premium cars because want have style, comfort and good qaulity materials in interior and most of them perform well too. All those mainstream cars style range from ugly to boring and interior from ugly to cheesy. Nobody mention Volvo S60 so far btw. I find it is cramped."
4943,sweendogy,January 2012,"speaking of darn packages - i jsut did a little research and while your pricing on both the infiniti and mb c350 are correct you failed to mention a couple of things-- ONE you maxed out a G37- meaning it has all the options premium, nav, and sports package... but with the MB it was a bait and switch approach - remember they have 2 colors for free paint other colors cost 700bux...sure you added 1k in wheels(need those 18 inchers remember) for your MB-- but where are the nav packages- the leather?- 1200 bux if you want xenon lights, 2700 for the backup and nav, 650 for keyless start..get my drift- these are in the packages you added for the G--  Your Build MSRP $40,575 Additional Costs $8,660 (this does not include a 700bux paint charge) Transportation Charge $875 Total $50,110  Estimate Payment (no thanks)  Pricing is powerful -but to prove your point you must be true  enjoy the VDUB (stay out of the left lane)"
4944,fedlawman,January 2012,"I optioned both cars the way YOU listed in your post (#12838): ""Price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers.""  I then explained that I don't like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the Mercedes I would personally order costs $41,450.  So, how is it on me that Infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? They do it on purpose to FORCE the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. Do you think it's an accident that in order to get the Sport Package, you also have to order the Navigation Package? That's $4000 for a laundry list of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your G37 to handle and stop a little better. :confuse:  So, if I were to buy a G37, I would have to pass on the Sport Package and simply get the Journey + Premium Package for $39,245. That's only $2000 less than the Mercedes. Every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the G37 (which is it's strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.  So how did this happen? Mercedes offers the C350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. This serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. Yes, if you want metallic paint on a European car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the Shiatsu Massage and Curb Feeler Packages to get it.  And enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. In this era of 300 hp family cars and 400 hp pony cars, 328 hp is nothing to brag about. If you really spend that much time in the left lane, I hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often. :P"
4945,sweendogy,January 2012,"guess im in the spin zone.. only 2k less- well yes lawman-(after you option them out the way you want it,)- its 2k less but again i guess i get the leather, the standard keyless start and yes the 700 paint job for free as well-- do i guess the spread is a little more then the 2k you speak of=- o wait i also get xenon lights which are standard on most as well.. please spare me on the ala cart stuff as if you add them up - you want leather well that will cost you, you forgot your previous arguement when you said the G fails to give standard features -- you want paint, you want leather, you want keyless start..your value being diminished is a joke- dollar for dollar-- its 7k in savings as equiped-- hello - thats some decent coin. The other thing you failed to mentioned is trying to find a MB as you want it with leatherette and no options-- good luck-- if you order one you will be paying msrp because you will have to order one.. please do homework because you are in a fight you cant win.. and your aggrument is strongly diminished..  The asian car companies ""force"" packages on you because it makes production easier-- and in doing so can offer a 328hp car for less.  I would rather you argue the VW passat vs the G25 then this -- please provide true $ for $ - or you will be called out and lose.  ive seen you in the rear mirror a couple of times-- this time on this topic--continue to take vw passat as this topic will pass in 2012.. have a happy new year."
4946,tlong,January 2012,"I would rather you argue the VW passat vs the G25 then this  Is the G25 engine harsh, too, or is it more refined than the G37? Isn't the 25 a four-banger?"
4947,sweendogy,January 2012,google.com  just came out- check it out
4948,tlong,January 2012,"google.com  just came out- check it out  I did that. It's a six and I found this posting when googling ""G25 NVH"":  ""Well I have to say this is a bit disappointing.  I was hoping for a ""G30"" with a VQ30DD or something, but instead we get a VQ25 that's down a bit on power and still has NVH issues?""  Thanks for the help sweeney! :P"
4949,tlong,January 2012,"I also found this interesting post courtesy Google:  ""In almost every comparison test where there has been a G35 tested against the E46 3 series, it has lost. You stick to thinking that your mad horzepowerz yo! is where it's at. All I gotta say is, I regret not test driving a 328 before I got my G37. I test drove the 335, and that car was utterly amazing, but for an extra 12k more, I decided to stick with the Infiniti. I got my bike for my speed fix. And that is what I should have thought about when I was buying the car. I thought the 328 would be disappointing after the 335 and the G37, but I was wrong. I test drove one a year after I got my G37 and the car drives amazing. The engine feels a million times smoother than the VQ and the throttle is not as abrupt. The clutch is a million times better. It absorbs bumps and imperfections on the road better as well. Other than the obvious lack of horsepower, which any adult really would not miss nor exploit on regular roads, the BMW, in any range of the 3 series, is a dynamically better car.  Every time a comparison is done, same complaints come up for the Infinitis....too much NVH from the engine, disconnected steering, non linear braking, poor clutch engagement...and what do they do every year? Up the horsepower....go figure.  And they do aim it at a certain audience that buys into it that believes that horsepower matter more than anything else."""

4954,dino001,January 2012,"MB and BMW are more expensive for comparable equipment. One could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to G or TL, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries.  However, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and C-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). There is really no excuse for that - 12K Kia and Hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. It's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" BS. I know, I have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding seats and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. What makes it worse, I see dealers actually ordering those without folding seats in large numbers. I can only imagine a brand new owner of 50K 335 trying to fold his/her seats and discovering the car doesn't have it. :sick: :lemon:  On many other options, I'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). I tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering), but bundling sports package with Nav is a little too much, even if I would order both anyway. To me it's OK to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports. But cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both.  For value-oriented people probably nothing beats Acura - you get everything except Nav/technology. I like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. We still don't have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on BMW in Europe - it's actually a book!!! Proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. Of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely. Not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50K+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there)."
4955,fedlawman,January 2012,"FWIW, I don't have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because I don't own any of the cars in this segment. Also, I can research (and maybe eventually purchase) a boring Passat or Subaru Outback for my wife without craving more excitement because I already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could.  M-B C350 Standard features missing on the G37 Journey:  *Sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers *Adaptive brakes with predictive brake priming, auto brake drying, and hill start assist *14 way power driver seat with power lumbar adjust *Power steering column *Driver memory with settings for seat, mirrors, and steering column *Auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror *Moonroof *Wood trim accents *Rain sensing automatic wipers *Split-fold rear seats *Harman Kardan Logic 7 450 Watt audio *9 airbags including pelvis and knee airbags *Attention Assist to detect driver drowsiness  G37 Journey standard features missing on the C350:  *Xenon headlamps *Leather seats *Keyless start *Free metallic paint  Please let me know if I've missed anything...  So, my assertion that the G37 lacks quite a few features seems to be valid. But more importantly, did you notice that most of the C350 features are performance or safety related while the G37 features are basically fluff? But to even things up as accurately as possible, let's load them both up as closely as we can...  So, a C350 with added Xenon headlamps, leather seats, Navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and Keyless Start costs $46,440.  Now, a G37 Journey with wood trim, Premium Package, Navigation Package, and Sport Package costs $45,045.  It looks like the Mercedes is $1400 more expensive than the G37.  But the G37 still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive brakes, and attention assist. Also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve assist and headlamp washers, split-fold rear seats, knee and pelvis airbags, and rain-sensing wipers.  The C350 lacks DVD playback, Zagat Restaurant Guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a Viscous Limited Slip.  Draw your own conclusions - I'm exhausted... :sick:"
4956,fedlawman,January 2012,"I discovered an error in my research. I'm not sure what I did, but the above described C350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (Edit: the $1750 leather seats didn't get added in)  I also just noticed that when I added the wood trim to the G37, it automatically added the $1200 Technology Package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. Since these are standard features on the C350, this doesn't change the math in my previous post.  The increase in the price of the C350 raises the gap between the Merc and Infiniti up to about $3150.  However, something else occurred to me...  Take the well equipped C350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, comfort, safety, or functionality.  The same C350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!  Now do the same thing with the above described G37 and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the Technology Package requires the wood trim. OK, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, they're part of the Sport Package that includes the upgraded suspension. Leather seats are standard, so that's not an option. OK, I hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? Sorry, it's part of the Premium Package which includes driver memory settings and Bose premium audio.  The C350 now costs $350 less than the G37. Bundles = :mad:"

4959,fedlawman,January 2012,What trim level and options does your G37 have?
4960,flightnurse,January 2012,"I believe we are the same age or close. I was very lucky to get a great job out of college.  So far I have owned all but one of my dream cars, and I have started the hunt for it, a Acrua NSX.  Willow Springs was my home track for both cars and motorcycles, having road raced many bikes at both Willow and Laguna Seca however Willow is home, both the streets and track.  Yes I have attended a few HPDE's, last one was at Firebird (which BTW isn't my fave track) but its a blast to be able to get the 330 sideways without worrying about the local police."
4961,fedlawman,January 2012,"Very cool Flightnurse. It's great that you have owned the cars you wanted to own (and bikes too!). I love the NSX - looks and performance still hold up. I see one on the road every now and then. Another car I love seeing but is pretty rare now is the 300ZX twin turbo. Not an NSX, but someone in my neighborhood has a cherry one and my heart skips a beat whenever I see it.  I went through a bike phase (Honda Hurricane 600) when I was in the Army. Then when I lived in L.A., my friends and I used to ride Mulholland and go to the Rock Store. I was a pretty good rider at 8/10ths, but I never got good enough or brave enough to go faster. I got hit by a car in 1990, sold the bike for parts, and never rode again."
4962,busiris,January 2012,"Sorry I was late to the party, but my special order experiences mirror those of NYC and Shipo.  Often, it's actually cheaper for a dealer to sell the same car special order .vs. from stock, as the dealership has no $$$ directly tied up in the special order vehicle, as he may have in one on the floor.  IMO, I have always done better negotiating for a special order than a floor model. Obviously, the dealer understands you are more educated about the potential vehicle, and that you are less willing to settle for something less than what you want.  The big drawback, of course, is the waiting period, and the uncertainty of the trade in value at the time of actual delivery."
4963,markcincinnati,January 2012,"Ordering a car is ""always"" less money than buying one in inventory.  Why?  #1 Dealer has a buyer and will not have any cost of borrowing or at most a very small cost of borrowing -- meaning the discount can be larger (""can be"" doesn't always mean ""will be,"" but hopefully you get the point.)  #2 Many of the LPS and ELLPS cars are ""on allocation"" -- as it was explained to me, ""the more cars I sell, the more cars I can get."" So, your order will potentially increase the total number of cars the dealer will be able to get, especially if the brand is from Europe, more specifically Germany.  Dealers love ordered cars -- I would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demo's in stock and have 50 or 60 cars on order every month.  As far as I know, this is the way it is done in Germany (mostly). You research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.  No instant gratification, but the buyer gets EXACTLY what he/she wants, not ""close enough for jazz"" as we do in the US.  I wanted a pearl white TL (check).  I wanted it with the Umber leather (apparently not possible this year and not even possible as a custom order like the Germans allow -- for $2,500 over the normal cost).  I accepted Pearl White with a Black Leather interior. I wanted the Advance package, too (check).  Actually come to think of it, the inability to order a car the way you want it, is a strike against Acura.  Oh hell . . .  As Meat Loaf says, ""two out of three ain't bad.""  Happy Freaking New Year!"
4964,nyccarguy,January 2012,"Excellent posts guys.  How fast can we really go on our public roads? How much power do we really need? We're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.  I live in Connecticut & Commute to The Bronx 6 days a week. The roads I drive on have mostly 50 mph (in NYC) & 55 mph (Westchester & CT). There's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway I take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit! 2 of my cars (Prelude & TSX) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines. Guess what? I seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80. If I slide my TSX shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.  I've got my Prelude Type SH as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance ramp attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that I drive to work once a week now.  The TSX is my daily driver. As much as I love driving my Prelude, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seats, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. My wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. She prefers driving the TSX solo as opposed to her 2011 Pilot which she chauffers the kids around in all week. It is nice to have 2 automatic transmission cars.    I do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different cars in this class.  No way would I even consider a G25X, only a Sport/Nav/Premium G37X.  With a BMW, the only way I could even think of affording a 335Xi is if it is a CPO car. Then I'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this CPO 335xi over a brand new optioned as I want 328xi? With the upcoming 320i w/ X drive 328i 2.0L Turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.  When the time comes, I'd have to check out the C350 as well. Who knows, BMW may have botched the electric power steering (it is LIFELESS in my TSX)? Maybe MBs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 L V6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. I might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. MBUSA's headquarters (as well as BMWUSA's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an MB Executive Demo car that's RWD instead of the run-of-the mill C300 4Matics that every dealership stocks. Maybe if I LOVE the Mercedes that much, I could live with a RWD car in CT. I'd be willing to live with MB Text instead of the full leather.  There's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the G37's engine. Fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their G37 Sedan.  It is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their cars & have been to driving schools too."
4965,dino001,January 2012,"It is funny, because the dealers would make you believe they're doing you such a favor by ordering a car the way you want it. Germans aren't so bad, but they always start their negotiations from ""if it's an order, it'll be at sticker"", like it was a rule or something. Even though, as you mentioned, an ordered car is lower cost to them, they want actually a larger profit on it. Classic reverse psychology: you came it, you want it just like it, you must be very motivated, so I'm charging you for that desire - if you walk away, no harm done to my bottom line, yet, as long as there are enough people to come and get something else. On the other hand, the one on my lot is sitting there, if you walk away, I'm still having a car to sell, so I better price it to sell now.  It's all instant gratification. When I ordered my 328i SportsWagon for ED followed by Performance Center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why I would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. Isn't that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? They're asking. Well, yes, but to me a deal on something you don't really want is not a deal at all."
4966,markcincinnati,January 2012,"I have been to three Audi (in Seefeld Austria) driving schools and one BMW driving school (here in the US in South Carolina). Both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""comfortably.""  I drive my 305HP TL so slowly on Interstate 71S on the way to downtown Cincinnati, I rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.  We had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our State Highway Patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the Audi and BMW driving schools even if they never use that term). The first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is NOT equipped with ABS (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with ABS vs non-ABS, the interview was cut short.  As I watched this interview unfold, I grew angry since the response from the cop was to NOT press hard on the brakes without ABS and I knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have ABS . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""  If anyone was about 75% paying attention, I would think they would press on their ABS equipped car's brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. Of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!  What is the % of ABS equipped cars? I've had it in all my cars since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.  Why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?  Oh crap, I'm way off topic.  Hmmm, let's see -- OK, I've got it.  All ELLPS and LPS (and most other cars on the market today) have BOTH ABS and Electronic Stability Control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!  Whew, hopefully I saved it. Sorry for going off track. I panicked.  Burma.  :blush:"
4967,busiris,January 2012,"I live less than 10 miles from the BMW Performance Center and have been on their track many times.  I agree with your comments about confusing the drivers about braking practices.  Its one of the 1st things you're taught by the Performance Center trainers when you pick up your new BMW car there, and I would guess well over 75% start out the day not knowing the proper procedure for braking in wet/icy conditions.  BTW, I never tire of spinning out on the skid-pad at the Performance Center track...."

4969,flightnurse,January 2012,"Talk about old school, 300ZX TT and Hurricane 600. So how does one contact you off this forum? The 300zx TT is a monster when it comes to maintenance.  First time to Europe I hired a Hurricane 600 in the UK, second time to Europe hired a 520i."
4970,rayainsw,January 2012,"Long post &#150; fair warning . . .  I do recognize that even a quarter mile blast [ to well over 100 MPH from a standing start, in my current BMW 3 ] is something I am unlikely to do anytime soon &#150; or anywhere but a race track. However, I use [ and I appreciate ] the ability to gain speed when I want or need to. The deep well of Torque available at most any RPM, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that I find quite satisfying.  Though I relish those occasions when I can apply WOT for more than a few seconds, I also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or drama. There is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the Corvette I drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.  This applies to the handling, as well. Though I never purposely approach 10/10 in my [ street ] driving, the feeling of precision and my sense that there is capacity well beyond what I will intentionally use results in a level of security that I value. Within the performance envelope I use, this feeling that I am always well inside the car&#146;s limits is of value &#150; to me.  So &#150; in addition to the quantifiable performance aspects [ acceleration rate, cornering Gs, etc. ], for me, that feeling or sense of capacity beyond what I can comfortably tap in my typical driving is one reason that I am willing to pay the price for something like the BMW 3.  I use the aspects of the performance that I think I prudently can, when and where I can &#150; and this other &#145;sense - touchy, feely&#146; stuff sustains me from one such occasion to the next. And helps keep my frustration in check.  - Ray Happy BMW customer . . ."
4971,flightnurse,January 2012,"Mark for me its not how fast I can drive my cars, but the pleasure it brings. For me, the BMW 3 series is a complete car, the seating position, the shifter, the feel of the car when driving. Can't get that with the G or the M (I currently have a M37X as a rental), Audi comes close, MB does have it. There are a couple of off amps and on ramps that really brings a smile to my face in Phoenix."
4972,flightnurse,January 2012,"NyCarguy BMW CPO is truly the best way to get your BMW, it comes with an extended warranty and you should be able to get the BMW with more equipment then you want for the same price."
4973,sweendogy,January 2012,Off and on ramps are straights - best left to cars that get up and go. The g and the M do have that.
4974,nyccarguy,January 2012,"I plan on waiting until my TSX is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a CPO F30 328i w/ XDrive when the time comes.  I too love pretty much everything about the current E90 3, including all the little details you listed. It is just too small for my needs. With 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving dynamics & rapid acceleration, I need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior. A stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an E90. A child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling. A rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.  We had an '07 X3. It had tons of rear seat room for child safety seats (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the comfort of the front passenger. Reliability wise, the car was perfect. Only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time. With 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb. She took out 2 tires and a wheel. She also needed an alignment to go with it. The service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldn't pass BMW lease end inspection and that I should replace them. I also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the X3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.  I should have bought the X3 at its lease end with it's brand new tires and stellar reliabiliy record. Plus I LOVED driving it. I had the TSX which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that I didn't want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old BMW with 46,000 miles. I had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so I figured keeping the Acura was a safe bet. Plus I wasn't thrilled with the X3's cargo room. The Acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.  Like I've said before, I like the TSX. A lot. It just isn't a car I picked out to be my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a Pilot. When the time comes to replace the TSX, I'm most certainly going to replace it with a BMW."

4979,nyccarguy,January 2012,I'd love for BMW to offer the F30 3 series sedan with a small (read: inexpensive) diesel & X-Drive. The extra range & availability of X-Drive will help sell more BMW diesels here in the Northeast.
4980,qbrozen,January 2012,"Well, the tendency to understeer is of course relative to the car. Not all do. And for those that do, a rear swaybar upgrade can take care of that, as can, to some degree, a front/rear differential in tire pressures (higher pressure in the rear will add oversteer).  The biggest advantage to AWD on the track, IMHO, is being able to get on the power much earlier and harder. Traction coming out of turns is critical, and, obviously, you get much more power down to the road with AWD.  My personal experience was with my G35x compared to all other vehicles I've autocrossed. I did not have to be at all careful with the X. Just all gas or all brakes and nothing in between. With every vehicle since, I've had to train my right foot to wait and then modulate."
4981,sweendogy,January 2012,"Big announcement is here- new rdx (based on the cr-v), the Ilx (civic based) which is a fwd smaller car, and finally the nsx which will be a awd hybrid. Looks like styling on the first 2 are inline with current offerings."
4982,nyccarguy,January 2012,"So than for your average non-tracking driver who enjoys on/off ramps & twisty back roads, the only advantage of AWD is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces?"
4983,billyperksii,January 2012,"The NSX is a looker-right, but three years is a long wait. What's going on with the RL- doesnt look like Acura is shooting for 8, maybe they will mimick the NSK 6cycl hybrid."
4984,sweendogy,January 2012,Nsx does look pretty cool. I don't know anything about the RL as it wasn't mentioned in anything I read about the auto show or on the Acura website. The new entry level caddy looks promising - lighter then most packing a 300hp eng.
4985,markcincinnati,January 2012,No.
4986,nyccarguy,January 2012,"Yeah, the new X5 M every 2 years is a drop in the bucket for him. His wife drives a '10 750 Li w/ X Drive. His 3rd garage is currently occupied by a Challenger SRT-8. I say currently because I think he's sold the Dodge & is one of the 1st on the list for a new M5."
4987,nyccarguy,January 2012,You are biting your tongue over there Mark.
4988,alltorque,January 2012,"This is a huge topic and lots of variables so probably no simple, definitive, answer.  As a simple soul I'd try, (and probably fail), to categorize as follows :  Given that the driver is reasonably competent in all cases then RWD takes some beating on a good dry track and the car can be beautifully ""balanced"" into/out of corners. On the rough stuff - gravel, forest tracks, (e.g. typical WRC special stages), or very wet conditions/snow etc then AWD will have advantages simply by having drive at all four corners. Then we get into weight distribution and front engine, mid-engine, rear engine configurations. Early Porsches were pretty quick but, in the hands of the unwary the engine hanging out the back would generally try and overtake the front of the car without much warning. Of course, a world class driver in either a FWD or RWD car will outperform an idiot in an AWD car, (of similar performance).  That's the simple version - probably."
4989,flightnurse,January 2012,"So they FINALLY going to make the next Gen NSX, With a V8 or V10 great, I wonder how much money they are going to lose on each one they sell?"
4990,flightnurse,January 2012,"Check this URL out, hopefully it explains everything.  http://www.autoworld.com/news/Audi/Quattro_system.htm  If AWD didn't have such an advantage then FIA wouldn't have banned AWD cars..."
4991,qbrozen,January 2012,"the only advantage of AWD is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces?  Well, essentially, yes. If you drive with a gentle foot and the primary drive wheels never lose traction, then the AWD would never kick in on many vehicles (those that are 100/0 split under normal conditions, that is)."
4992,qbrozen,January 2012,"that's all about racing, though. His question now is whether, in nonracing nonadverse conditions, AWD has any advantages. I personally can't think of any. I mean, if you NEVER get into a situation where you need the added traction, then it is just extra baggage."
4993,Kirstie_H,January 2012,"(not directed toward anyone in particular...)  Let's not do this again - the FWD vs RWD vs AWD, or any combination of those.

4996,kdshapiro,January 2012,The questions are will anybody care and what will the competition be doing?
4997,markcincinnati,January 2012,"As I suspected the HOST would intervene -- and rightfully so and put a screeching halt to the two driven wheels vs four driven wheels ""discussion.""  There are many threads, here on edmunds and hundreds (or more) all over the 'net, that have beaten this topic damn near into submission.  If you need additional information, the link provided above pertaining to quattro should be one of your first stops. Then let Google or Bing or Dogpile be your friend and search the web to your heart's content.  So yes, I am biting my tongue because the real answer to your question about AWD being just for low coefficient of friction (i.e., slick) conditions isn't a direct ""yes"" or ""no"" -- like so many things in life the truth is ""it all depends.""  Moreover, the RWD mavens and the AWD mavens for that matter will probably never agree even with tons of data -- because the data will undoubtedly be presented with qualifying statements. Then one of us here will latch on to a qualified statement and proclaim it as the universal truth.  Of course Audi's piece (the link referenced above) is marketing material. Yet unless they have misrepresented the facts they cite, their statements should not be dismissed just because of ""your"" bias for 2 wheel drive (and that means RWD, virtually all of the time.)  Ever wonder why the discussion seems to be AWD vs RWD and that there are many supporters of those two approaches who are ""gunning"" for a fight, er, ""discussion?""  I have sometimes wondered: Why is it that there are none (or perhaps virtually none) willing to proclaim the best system is 2 driven wheels (and that those wheels should be the FRONT wheels)?  We have folks almost willing to come to fisticuffs to defend and ""prove"" that RWD is most righteous; likewise AWD. Where are the FWD defenders?  Me, I think all autos in the ELLPS and LPS classes should at least offer AWD and if they don't they shouldn't be in those classes, no matter how many technical do-dads can be ticked off on the option list.  My cousin just got that fancy schmanzy 2012 KIA Optima SX with everything on it -- the thing even comes with heated REAR seats (like my $53K Audi A6) -- but, I would assume the FWD and the sub $30,000 price, etc, keep it out of the ELLPS and LPS classes.  In any case, I have the 2WD vs 4WD thing out of MY system for a while at least -- and remember I said I did not want us to start down the path (the ""discussion"") that has been done and re-done and re-re-done so many times here at or in this very web site.  I know I can't win but I'll just end wondering why if AWD is really only for slick surfaces, that the World Motor Sport Association forbade four-wheel drive in their events as an ""unfair advantage."" :surprise:"
4998,sweendogy,January 2012,"Wow- that was powerfully written- We all can agree that Fwd stinks- Rwd is cool, awd gives a sense of security.  Drive like you live Sween"
4999,shipo,January 2012,I like some FWD cars (our new GTI is a prime example) I like some RWD cars (my former 530i was a prime example) I like some AWD cars (our A4 Quattro is a prime example)  I guess I'm fickle. :shades:
